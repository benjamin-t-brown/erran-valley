The painted portrait of a well-dressed man, featuring a velvet coat of dark purple and elaborately embroidered cuffs with golden buttons, hung upon a wall at the back of the apartment.  He was middle-aged, though he still sported elegant blond hair; long, flowing, and tied in a regal top knot with a red ribbon.  His gaunt cheeks reflected a stern countenance, accentuated by sharp eyebrows and pursed lips.  The canvas upon which he had been painted was very old, thatching having been cheaply repaired in several places, though still some obvious scuffs dotted near the corners.  The man gazed out over the room with a certain regality; a man surveying his domain, exuding total ownership and expectations of admiration for it.

A clock on the opposite wall ticked, the only sound in the room, its face showing precisely 4:15.  The water-stained wallpaper behind it had been scratched and torn in several places, and a hasty, slightly discolored paint had been applied to the worst of the splotches.  Nails and screws dotted here and there, but neither pictures nor shelves were upon the wall.  An overflowing trashcan stood below this clock, flies buzzing around a piece of mostly-eaten bread atop the mass, green and blue mold visible on the remaining crust.  The wooden floor beneath, rough and scratched, was considerably dirty and littered with crumbs, having not been swept for a long while.

A four-person table and chairs were shoved into a cramped corner by the only window, through which shone an early-morning beam of sun, highlighting the specks of dust in the air.  Plates from a previous nightâ€™s dinner, possibly spaghetti, were stacked on the corner of the table, dirty napkins and utensils strewn about next to them.  A bowl of almost black bananas lay upon the tiny counter top which separated the table from the kitchen, with an empty roll of paper towels next to it.  Dirty plates and pots obstructed the sink, and a clog had backed up the water inside, bits of food floating on the foamy surface.  An open cabinet door showed a bare pantry, only a few cans of canned green beans and expired hot sauce packets pushed into the back corners.  The light switch near the fridge was flipped on, but neither of the two ceiling lights were lit.

At the opposite end of the room, upon a lumpy couch, a young woman slept on her stomach.  She snored into a cushion, head buried in the corner, arms barricaded beneath her chest.  She clutched a thin blanket around her shoulders, legs curled beneath her chest, trying to fend off the chilly air in the room.  The coffee table next to her held several empty beer cans and bottles, a few shot glasses, and several torn bits of paper.  Duct tape ran the length of the rug below the couch and table, withered edges curling upwards sticky parts covered in carpet lint.  A television remote lay on the floor, batteries taken from the back of it and placed in the old game controller stuffed into the couch.

The man in the portrait oversaw all these things from this vantage on the wall, but from here he could only see two doors.  The first was a very normal door.  It was the front door; the one leading outside.  The dirt-caked welcome mat beneath it was covered in old shoes, strewn about haphazardly, most missing their pair, and a rusty deadbolt kept it firmly closed.  But the second door, an oak door at the end of a hallway adjacent to the couch, seemed much more sinister.   Although it appeared otherwise unremarkable - perhaps slightly taller than normal, and rather sturdy-looking - something about the way it stood seemed macabre.  Natural light did not touch it, the hallway in which it resided having been shrouded in darkness, and thin cracks ran along the base of the door, signs that it had been slammed many times.  Perhaps it was a trick of the low lighting, but the frame of portrait appeared tilted slightly away from that hallway, the proud man upon it seeming to avert his eyes from that oak door.

With a small *click*, the the handle turned and the door opened.

Crossing quickly into the hallway, Jesse carefully closed the door behind her and made her way into the kitchen.

The woman on the couch, whose name was Felicity, moaned slightly, rolling over and shivering as the blanket pulled from her bare shoulders.  She blinked a few times, dazed.

"Jesse?" the woman asked groggily.

Reaching into a drawer and pulling out a small, plastic container, Jesse threw threw it onto the woman's lap.  "Get up.  They need you in the Alley."

"I'm fine," the woman said, pushing the container onto the floor.  It clattered to the floor, the two or three pills inside rattling like a maraca.  "I don't need any more."

"Get up, then," Jesse repeated.  "You're missing your shift."

Felicity pulled the blanked over her shoulder and curled into a ball.  "Coramc's taking care of it."

Jesse's lips contorted into a thin line.  "Is he going to bartend for you?"

"Don't be silly."  Felicity reached a hand upward and pointed at the ceiling.  She formed a gun with her fingers and fake shot it.  "Says he's got a replacement."

"Another part of his harem?"

Felicity hummed.  "He's good to me, isn't he?"

"Felicity..."  Jesse reached to her temples, rubbing them.  She groaned.  "I'm going over there.  We can't afford you losing that job."

"Oh?" Felicity said.  She perked her head up, eying Jesse.  "I thought you wouldn't debase yourself anymore?"

The slamming of the front door was the response.

The Alley was the name of a bar at the eastern end of the largest Tyzon warehouse complex in the city.  It was a small building, at the base of the concrete wall that surrounded the complex, sitting right next to the gate to the inside.  It just happened to be within walking distance of Jesse's current lodgings.

Jesse strode firmly through the double doors at the front and surveyed the inside.  The place was still mostly empty at this time of day, though some early birds and regulars dotted the here and there, hunched over their drinks and mostly keeping to themselves.  A cursory glance was enough to she saw the man she sought.  Cormac sat at a round table, booted feet propped up on a nearby chair, arms spread around the backs of others.  His customary sneer adorned his face as he shot words towards a promiscuous bartender, who was laughing nervously.

"Come on over.  I'm in a good mood today."  He had a way of speaking that made his voice stick out more than any other in the room, though he never shouted.  "We can start early."

Another man sat at the table beside him, this one much more reserved than his companion, but certainly no less noticeable.  Arnold, a bear of a man who stood 6'8" with forearms thicker than Jesse's legs, was the owner of this bar.  Four shot glasses stood in front of him, a fifth in his hands, reflecting the neon lights that lined the bar as he washed it thoroughly with a damp cloth.  He was bald, a tattoo of a black fleur-de-lis wrapped its way around his neck up the back of his head.  When asked about it, he would just grunt and mutter something about World War 2.

Jesse picked her way over to the table, threading her way between the rickety barstools and wobbly tables scattered around the sitting area.  Cormac spotted her almost immediately.

"Well, if it isn't the beautiful sister of my finance.  You here to join us?"

Ignoring him, Jesse turned her attention to Arnold.  "Felicity won't be coming for her shift today."

Arnold kept polishing the glass.  "Yep.  I know.  Cormac told me."

"I'm willing to do it.  Just please... don't fire her."

With an eyebrow raised, he scanned her up and down.  "Thought you said you wouldn't do that anymore."

"Just this once," Jesse said.  She put her palm on the table.  "So long as Felicity keeps her job."

To the side, Cormac whistled.  "That's what they all say.  Even the good ones."  He flicked a piece of lint from his sleeve, and eyed her.  "Just like you."

Arnold folded his thick arms, sitting up straight.  He dwarfed the little bar stool, and it groaned and creaked as if it were about to give out.  "You realize this is the third time this month?"

"She will get better.  She just needs more time."

He chuckled at that, a low rumble that resembled a minor earthquake.  "Well, you're in luck today."  He nodded towards the bar where the nervous-looking bartender still stood.  "Cormac got me a replacement already.  So no need for you here..."  He turned back to Jesse with a level stare.  "I guess I can overlook today."

Jesse let out the breath she had been holding.  "Good," she said, almost as a whisper.

"Now you owe me another one, gorgeous," Cormac said.  He gave an insufferable wink as his boots slid off the chair and clunked on the floor.  "Though I'd have loved to see you behind that bar again.  It suits you."

His comment was met with a glare from Jesse.

"Oh come on now?  How about a little 'thank you?', eh?"  He stood then, and took a step around the table towards her.  "It's really the least you could do."

Jesse took a guarded step away from him.  "You didn't do her any favors," she said.  "She needs this.  She can't keep relying on you."

"Should a wife not depend on her husband?"

"You're not married yet."

"We will be," he said, grinning.  He took another step towards her, and Jesse began to reach behind her back.  He noticed the motion, and his grin became wider.  Then he laughed; a hearty, full bellied guffaw that had him bent over double.  Jesse regarded him carefully as it faded, and he leaned on a chair for support.  "One of these days, Jesse.  You'll warm up to me."

Jesse's face tightened.

A shot glass clunked on the table, and Arnold interrupted them.  "You really are in a good mood, aren't you?"

Abruptly Cormac's attention left Jesse.  He looked at Arnold.  "Why, yes, I am.  I got a little task from one of my Tyzon contacts.  The best kind.  Lucrative and easy.  Thought you could help me with it, old friend."  He walked back to his chair, where an overcoat hung.  He rummaged inside for a bit before pulling out a small pen-sized stick.  He tossed it onto the table, where it rolled a few times before finally stopping at a small dimple inlayed on the tip.  It buzzed slightly, then began to hum as a holographic screen winked into view.  Arnold leaned closer to study the text displayed on it.

"You know any of those girls?" Cormac asked, pointing at the screen.  "I picked out the ones I thought I might have seen here once or twice."

"A couple," Arnold said.  "What do you want from them?"

"Just want to get to know them," Cormac said, with a casual shrug.  "If you can point me towards them, I'll cut you a share of the prize."

Arnold shook his head, and a large hand came up to massage the back of his neck.  "I'm not even gonna ask," Arnold said.  "This sounds like trouble."

"It's not!  They're just paying for info, that's all."

Jesse frowned.  She had been leaning over, examining the contents of the screen.  It contained the quite-detailed profiles of several girls: pictures, names, birth-dates, descriptions, and, curiously, a curt description of their parentage.  They were grouped by high school, and as Jesse scanned she saw an entry for Erran Valley with a single student listed inside it. Adalais Eldridge.

"They're paying to know about a bunch of high-schoolers?  That's bad business."

"You hire them all the time!"

"That's different."

Cormac dropped back into his chair.  "Sounds like you'll need some convincing.  No worries, I got time."  He leaned his head back over the top of his chair and shouted with his eyes closed.  "Can I get a little SERVICE here!"  He perked up and glanced at Jesse.  "You sticking around too.  Drinks on me."

Shivers rattled through Jesse at invitation.  She turned on her heel and left the bar, trying to ignore the whistle Cormac gave as the doors closed.
