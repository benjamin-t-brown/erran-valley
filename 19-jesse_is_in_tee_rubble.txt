The painted portrait of a well-dressed man, featuring a velvet coat of dark purple and elaborately embroidered cuffs with golden buttons, hung upon a wall at the back of the apartment.  He was middle-aged, though he still sported elegant blonde hair; long, flowing, and tied in a regal top knot with a red ribbon.  His gaunt cheeks reflected a stern countenance, accentuated by sharp eyebrows and pursed lips.  The canvas upon which he had been painted was very old, thatching having been cheaply repaired in several places, though still some obvious scuffs dotted near the corners.  The man gazed out over the room with a certain emenance, one of total ownership and expectations of admiration.

A clock on the opposite wall ticked, the only sound in the room, its face showing precisely 7:15.  The water-stained wallpaper behind it had been scratched and torn in several places, and a hasty, slightly discolored paint had been applied to the worst of the splotches.  Nails and screws dotted here and there, but neither pictures nor shelves were upon the wall.  An overflowing trashcan stood below this clock, flies buzzing around a piece of mostly-eaten bread atop the mass, green and blue mold visible on the remaining crust.  The wooden floor beneath, rough and scratched, was considerably dirty and littered with crumbs, having not been swept for a long while.

A four-person table and chairs were shoved into a cramped corner by the only window, through which shone an early-morning beam of sun, highlighting the specks of dust in the air.  Plates from a previous night’s dinner, possibly spaghetti, were stacked on the corner of the table, dirty napkins and utensils strewn about next to them.  A bowl of almost black bananas lay upon the tiny countertop which separated the table from the kitchen, with an empty roll of paper towels next to it.  Dirty plates and pots obstructed the sink, and a clog had backed up the water inside, bits of food floating on the foamy surface.  An open cabinet door showed a bare pantry, only a few cans of canned green beans and expired hot sauce packets pushed into the back corners.  The lightswitch near the fridge was flipped on, but neither of the two ceiling lights were lit.

At the opposite end of the room, upon a lumpy couch, a young woman slept on her stomach.  She snored into a cushion, head buried in the corner, arms barricaded beneath her chest.  She clutched a thin blanket around her shoulders, legs curled beneath her chest, trying to fend off the chilly air in the room.  The coffee table next to her held several empty beer cans and bottles, a few shot glasses, and several torn bits of paper.  Duct tape ran the length of the rug below the couch and table, withered edges curling upwards sticky parts covered in carpet lint.  A television remote lay on the floor, batteries taken from the back of it and placed in the old game controller stuffed into the couch.

The man in the portrait oversaw all these things from this vantage on the wall, but from here he could only see two doors.  The first was a very normal door.  It was the front door; the one leading outside.  The dirt-caked welcome mat beneath it was covered in old shoes, strewn about haphazardly, most missing their pair, and a rusty deadbolt kept it firmly closed.  But the second door, an oak door at the end of a hallway adjacent to the couch, seemed much more sinister.   Although it appeared otherwise unremarkable - perhaps slightly taller than normal, and rather sturdy-looking - something about the way it stood seemed macabre.  Natural light did not touch it, the hallway in which it resided having been shrouded in darkness, and thin cracks ran along the base of the door, signs that it had been slammed many times.  Perhaps it was a trick of the low lighting, but the frame of portrait appeared tilted slightly away from that hallway, the proud man inside averting his eyes, pretending that the oak door did not exist.

But the scene changed at the first door, the front door. With a small *click*, the deadbolt slid inward.

Jesse hurried inside, nearly tripping over the threshold in her haste.  In one hand she carried her backpack, and in the other, she clutched a small, white bag.  She dropped the backpack on the ground then strode across the kitchen, turned into the hallway, put a hand on the handle of the oak door, and marched inside, closing it firmly behind her.

The woman on the couch moaned slightly, rolling over and shivering as the blanket pulled from her bare shoulders.  She blinked her eyes a few times, looking a bit dazed.

The oak door opened again and Jesse came out, hands empty.

“Jesse?” the woman asked groggily.

“Felicity,” Jesse called back, narrowing her eyes.  She walked to the foot of the couch and stopped, folding her arms.   “Where the hell is your good-for-nothing fiance?” she put as much force into the word as possible.

“Good-for-nothing?”  Felicity stared blankly at Jesse for a second.  “But he’s not...”  She blinked.  “Ugh...”  She rubbed her temples.  “He said...  he was going out or something.  One of his friends needed him.”

Jesse cocked her head to the side, furrowing her brow.  “Remember when you said he'd go to the pharmacy?”

Felicity opened her mouth, then promptly closed it, eyes widening.  “I… think he forgot about that.”

“You think?” Jesse said.

Felicity started to panic.  She rolled her feet from the couch, and threw off the blanket, intending to stand.  “What do we do?”

Jesse put a hand out to stop her.  “Stop.  I took care of it okay?  It’s fine for now.”

“Thank goodness,” Felicity said, slumping back.  Then she cocked her head.  "But how did you…?"

"I just did okay.  We'll leave it at that."

Felicity eyed Jesse suspiciously, then a smile curled on her lips.  "I never knew you had it in you, dear sister."

"I don't," Jesse said, looking away.  "I'm not you."

Felicity hummed in response.

“I can’t believe we’re in this situation,” Jesse said.  She put a hand to her forehead.  “That I’d ever thought to rely on Cormac.  He’s a dick, Felicity.  He probably went out drinking again.  Honestly I don’t know what you see in him.”

“He’s got other things on his mind,” Felicity said.  “And don’t call him that.  He has a good side too.”

“Well I’ve never seen it.  I just wish one time he would think about somebody other than himself!”

Felicity’s eyes flashed dangerously.  “You’re no angel yourself.  When was the last time you spoke to him directly?  You know, every time he stays, I don't see you around.  I wonder.  Are you, maybe, afraid of him?”

Jesse fell silent, glaring at her sister.

"Just a thought, I had," Felicity said.  "I think he knows you're afraid.  I can't really blame him for forgetting about you."

"You know what he's capable of, Felicity," Jesse's voice was low and angry.  "What he's done…"

"The past is the past," Felicity said, brushing away the air in front of her with her hand.  "And what would you know about his situation?  You never talk to him.  Not since…"  She fell silent, and something seemed to dawn on her face.  "Ah.  My my, Jesse.  You're more of a coward than I thought."

"Just shut up!" Jesse shouted.

The clock on the wall ticked, the only sound in the room as the two women glared at each other.  But eventually, Felicity looked up at it.   “Aren’t you supposed to be at school?” she asked tersely.

Jesse groaned.  “Yes,” she said, glancing up and grimacing.  She made her way to the door and picked up her backpack, looking back at Felicity.  “You’re lucky I remembered to check this morning.  We need to have a talk when I get back.  Please, try to be awake when I get home.”

Felicity was not listening.  She fell back over onto the couch and pulled the blanket back over herself.

Jesse opened the door and took a step out, but her eye caught the portrait of the man in the corner.  Her gaze locked with his for the briefest moment, and her frown deepened.  Then she was turning away striding through the threshold.  Outside, her breath puffing in moist clouds in front of her face, she flung her backpack onto her back and began to run.

The moment she had awoken this morning, restless sleep having been interrupted by dark dreams, Jesse knew it was going to be a bad day.  She stubbed her toe while getting dressed, remembered that she had neglected two homework assignments the night before, and reaffirmed that Cormac was a giant asshole.  The thought of him being her brother-in-law made Jesse want to puke.  This could not be allowed to continue.  But what could she do about it?  Cormac was just so… so… troublesome.

Jesse shook her head and banished the thought of Cormac and Felicity and all her other problems from her mind.  They were too unpleasant to think about.

The sculpture had not come out quite correct.  Its eyes were too hollow, nose too curved, shoulders too misshapen.  The colors clashed with the clay, and the pose looked unrealistic.  But there it sat on the first-place pedestal of the art showcase, behind a pane of plastic glass, above two vastly superior works.

Jesse frowned at her clay statue in contempt.  Why had this won any sort of prize?  She had been so preoccupied lately that she had neglected to give it the care she normally did.  The piece was a train wreck, honestly.  She barely remembered even spending the time to make it.  She felt ashamed that it had been hefted for all the school to see.  She turned away from the display, shaking her head, and resumed her walk away from the art classroom.

Today, Ms. Brugler had planned a 'finger-painting' period, obsessively talking about her two-year-old nephew, Desmond, who had inspired her with the idea.  Jesse had made a serious attempt, but the other five students were not nearly as enthused.  They gave up rather quickly and went off to sketch, leaving Jesse alone in the room with Ms. Brugler for the remainder of the period, who kept muttering odd compliments to her… things like "It's clear you have the mind of a child," and "Just like little Desi."  Before class ended, Jesse had popped outside intending to go to the bathroom and wash off.  Her hands were so covered in red and brown paint that it looked like she had just murdered somebody.  She stood alone in the hallway outside the art room, having been distracted by the showcase.  

It had been somewhat rough for Jesse lately.  Homecoming was to be held this weekend, and though Jesse had not made plans to attend, she had been forced to facilitate the drama that it generated amongst her friends.  Apparently, Millie had been mistaken in her certainty that Sean would ask her out.  So a distressed Millie spoke to Ethan about it, who himself had been having doubts about Eirika and was wondering whether or not to break it off.  With some jealousy-fueled malice, Millie had also told Eva about this, and she had not been able to keep it a secret from Eirika, who had then, in swift retribution, went and asked out Sean, who, it turned out, already had a date with another girl named Amanda, a freshmen that none of the group knew - but of course they all thought she was some kind of harlot.  Jesse had pieced together this collapse via a combination of angry, hour-long phone calls with Eva and Millie - sometimes at the same time - and a few teary-eyed confessions from Eirika and Ethan, and even a frustrated texting session with Sean, who could usually outlast a boulder for how stony his emotions stayed.  They all used her just to vent, and it had left Jesse stressed and exhausted.  If Vivi had not made the starting lineup for the basketball team, Jesse expected she would have been overwhelmed.

She began walking across the second-floor landing, towards the junior hallway bathroom, making sure that her hands were firmly shoved into the pockets of her hoodie.  They did look rather convincingly bloody and bruised, and Jesse did not want to have to explain herself.   She had other things on her mind at the moment.

But before she got halfway across the landing, the bell rang.  Students burst from the doors and quickly began crowding the area.   She had dawdled for too long at the art booth. She ducked her head and quickened her pace.  The bathroom was not much further.

With a few steps remaining, a girl emerged from the classroom door to her left and nearly ran into Jesse.  She staggered away, and, looking down, recognized who it was.  "Ada?" Jesse blurted out.

Ada was the last student leaving the physics classroom.  Books held to chest, she tilted her head up at Jesse with look of combined boredom and annoyance.  But something was off about her… bags beneath her eyes, an apparent slouch, a slight limp…  Were those creases of worry around her temples?

"Do I know you?" Ada said in a frosty tone.

Almost a head taller, Jesse peered down at Ada.  "We haven't met…"  She trailed off.  This close, she noticed something behind Ada's harsh, green eyes: a tight strain, like something inside her was roiling within her tiny frame, and she had to fight tooth and nail to keep herself together.  It was a feeling that Jesse herself knew all too well.  Knew, and hated.  In that instant, Jesse knew that she had to find a way to help this girl.  Somehow.

Suddenly she realized she was staring and took a hasty step back.  "Excuse me," she coughed. "My name is Jesse."

In response, Ada merely raised a sharp eyebrow.

"I was wondering," Jesse continued, slowly, "if maybe you'd like to have lunch with me?"

Ada's eyes narrowed.  "Why?"

Biting her lip, Jesse hesitated.  "Because… I think that I may be able to… to help you."

For a brief moment, Ada's eyes widened in surprise, but instantly they resumed a suspicious stare.  She looked Jesse up and down, finally returning her gaze to Jesse's.

"Help me with what, exactly?" she asked.

Jesse flashed a smile.  "I kind of just want to be your friend."

"Is that so?" Ada said.  Abruptly, her eyes flicked to her left and back again.  Jesse followed her gaze to the concrete wall beside which they both stood.  Nothing was there.  "The answer is 'no'.  I do not have time for you right now.  Please move out of the way so I can attend my next class."

"Pretty please?" Jesse said.  "Can't you just give me a chance?"

A hint of anger darkened Ada’s face.  "No," she repeated flatly.  "And whatever it is that you think you can help me with; I can deal with it on my own.  I do not need your help."  She punctuated the last with a finger in Jesse's chest.

Jesse brushed it aside.  "You can fight this all you want, but eventually you and I are going to be friends."  It was true.  Jesse would not stop until she got under Ada's skin.

Indignation flooded across Ada, but before she could respond somebody, shouted behind the both of them.

"Oh my god, Jesse!  What happened to your hands!?"  The whole hallway hushed as people turned her direction.  Nearby students started speaking in alarm.

"Are you alright, Jesse?"

"Here, Jesse, you can wrap them in this handkerchief."

"Who hurt you, Jesse? I’ll pound them into the ground!"

Jesse spun to see what looked like the entire student body on the second floor staring at her.  She colored.  "It's fingerpaint everyone!"  she said hurriedly.  "Just fingerpaint; I'm fine!"  She looked over her shoulder to catch a glimpse of Ada sneaking through the mob.  She tried to follow, but the students closed in on her, insisting on giving her aid which she did not need.  She groaned in frustration.

After some explaining and some cajoling, she had calmed everyone down - though she was not fully sure that she had fully convinced a remarkably upset Hank Macelry, a starting linemen for the football team, that she had not been physically assaulted by somebody.  He kept flexing and making fists, staring at other students suspiciously as if he were about to invoke violence upon them at the slightest hint they had anything to do with Jesse's hands.  But ultimately it had taken just a few more words and a hug to calm him down enough to send him away.  A minute later she was cleaning her hands in the bathroom, before eventually returning to her locker.

She opened it, a tinge of a frown appearing on her face at the sight of the weather-beaten and torn literature textbook lying on top of the stack inside.  Skye had returned it in this disdainful condition, and naturally had not possessed the grace to apologize for it.  Jesse picked up the volume, trying in vain to smooth several back-folded pages, but ultimately dropped it again.  She sighed.

Truth be told, it wasn't really the book that bothered her at the moment.  It was clear to her that Ada was one of those girls who would remain hostile until you got into their good graces.  The trouble was, how was she going to do that?  It would take no small amount of persistence, of course.  But would she respond to kindness, or harshness?  And what was that odd flick of the eyes to the wall about?  And why did she seem so exhausted?

"You're more air-headed than usual." Skye said briskly, brushing behind her.  Jesse shivered and realized she had been staring down at the literature book for the past minute.  She blinked and turned to Skye who had opened her own locker and haphazardly tossed an armful of books into it.

"Skye… Do you know anybody named Ada?"  It wasn't a serious question, and Jesse certainly did not expect an answer, but Skye considered for a moment, looking up at the ceiling.

"Short girl -  brown hair -  sharp nose - flower scrunchy?  Probably a Freshmen?"

Jesse nodded, eyebrows shooting up in surprise.  "Yeah!"

"Yup," said Skye, pushing a strand of black hair out of her face.  "Met her last week.  She’s pretty cool."

"You actually know her?"

"Not really.  I saw her at the GDL arena."

Jesse did not know what that was, but something else bothered her.  "You actually liked her?  You didn’t think she was a little… mean?"

Skye laughed.  "Nah not really.  She seemed fine to me.  Blunt maybe?  You should see her play GDL though, it’s really funny."

"GDL?" Jesse asked.

With a condescending sigh, Skye patted Jesse’s head.  "Nevermind."  She stepped past Jesse and walked away.

Jesse watched her leave, a confused frown on her face as she imagined just what Ada had done to impress somebody like Skye; and also what Skye had done to impress somebody like Ada.  It was becoming very clear that Jesse was missing something here.
