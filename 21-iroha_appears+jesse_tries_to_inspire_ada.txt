On Wednesday morning, Ada awoke with some soreness, but she felt much better than the previous few days.  It gave her a surge of confidence.  She was finally improving!

This elation lasted only momentarily as she caught sight of her backpack, and was abruptly reminded of the unfinished homework inside.  Unfortunate, but it could not be helped.  She had been too exhausted to finish it.  She would have to find time later today to do it.  She dressed and prepared for school.

The general hum and bustle of students reverberated off the plaster walls of the U.S. History classroom.  Chairs scraped across carpet, books hit upon desks, and papers fluttered from folders, students chatted.  The first years had developed a certain restlessness now that the awkwardness of a new school setting had subsided with time.  Ada followed a lanky boy into the classroom, hefting the extra binder she had brought with her.  This was the last class she had to finish her work before it was due.  She had to risk it.

Making certain to dissociate herself with the cliques and groups clumping about the room, Ada threaded her way between desks and chairs, taking an open seat in the column furthest from the door.  A few rows in front of Ada, at the teacher’s desk, stood Mrs. Marish, a middle-aged woman, short, wearing a grey cardigan and slacks.  She was unloading her book bag on her chair, sorting what looked to be a heavy sack into two separate piles.  A stack of paper resided on the corner of her desk and a folded card lay next to this stack, the words "Take One," scrawled in hasty, blocky lettering.

Mrs. Marish gazed at Ada as she approached the desk and took a syllabus.  Ada inclined her head respectfully, though she also did not speak.  She turned and walked back to her desk, adjusting the scrunchy on her ponytail to appear unconcerned.  She sat down, aligning her pencil box in the top right corner and centering the paper in front of her.  She scanned it quickly, and recognized it for some sort of rubric.  Great.  More work.  She sighed as she pulled out her binder and began the process of slotting it in the correct spot.
 
The clock a few feet above Ada’s head struck eight, and the tell-tale beep of the bell played through the loudspeaker next to it.  Slowly the room dispersed into desks.  Ada took the opportunity to overlay her unfinished homework and began to write answers on it.

"Alright, let’s begin," Mrs. Marish said primly, placing a final book on the pile.  She turned to the whiteboard, picked up a marker, and started to write a bulleted list.  "Hopefully you all have manged to take a sheet from the front.  These points--"  She abruptly stopped speaking, just now noticing the girl who still stood in the front of the classroom.

This girl, clearly of Asian descent, stood just to the side of the whiteboard, smiling eagerly at Mrs. Marish.  Her attire was of a school-girl uniform: a white-collared shirt and a checkered skirt, with a gray sweatshirt tied around her waist.  Black socks stretched to her knees and she tapped her clogs up and down as she tiptoed excitedly.  An elegant braid fell over her left shoulder, a large, golden ring tied to the end.  Loopy earrings framed a face with a copious makeup, accentuating her sharp eyebrows, high cheekbones, and angular nose.

"Excuse me," Mrs. Marish said.  "Why haven’t you taken your seat?"

The girl stopped bouncing on her toes.  "Aren’t you forgetting something, Mrs. Marish?" she said.  Her voice was high pitched, perhaps 'cute' came to mind.

Mrs. Marish frowned and looked around, first at her desk, then at the rest of the students in the room, then the whiteboard, and finally back to the girl.  "No, I don’t believe I am.  Please take your seat."

The girl lingered though, a puzzled expression forming on her face.  She turned to the whiteboard and grabbed a black marker.  Uncorking it, she placed the marker on the board and started writing.  The whole class watched in silence as she finished jotting down "Iroha" first in English, then in apparently Japanese, because after she returned to add cat ears to the ‘a’ in her name, she drew a surprisingly-accurate outline of the country and labeled it, dotting Tokyo in the bottom right corner.  She capped the marker and spun around.  "Hello everyone!" she said brightly, winking and waving.  "I’m Iroha.  I’m a new transfer student here!  It’s so nice to meet you!"  She bowed, her short hair whipping around her ears.

The class all stared at the top of her head for a few seconds.

Iroha stood from her bow and handed the marker to Mrs. Marish whose face held an inscrutable expression.  Then Iroha turned and surveyed the classroom.  There was an awkward pause.

A tinge of a smile played on Mrs. Marish’s lips, but it quickly evaporated as she assumed a regal sternness that brooked no nonsense.  "I see..." she said, raising her hands.  "I was planning to introduce later, Miss Iroha, but it seems you've taken care of that."  She gave Iroha a little push in the back.  "Go on, sit down.  It's about time we begun."

Iroha stumbled but caught herself and made her way towards the only open desk in the room: the one directly in front of Ada.  Ada pointedly avoided eye contact but noticed that Iroha took great care in smoothing her skirt and placing her folder just so at the corner of her desk. Just another girl who sought attention… nothing of note.  She resumed work on her unfinished assignment.

Somewhat surprisingly, Iroha remained silent and respectful for the remainder of the period.  In fact, despite the unconventional opening, the entire class was so quiet and well-behaved that Mrs. Marish managed to complete her intended lesson early.  She went over the last point - a redundant warning not to skip exams - then blinked and shrugged.

"I suppose that's it then," she said.  "I've not got anything else for you today.  Talk amongst yourselves for a few minutes until the period ends."

As a small buzz formed in the classroom, Ada pulled out the binder she had set aside for US History, and slid the syllabus through the rings, making sure not to tear the paper.  She closed the binder, then looked up to see Iroha standing in front of her desk.

"Hi there!" she said brightly.  "I’m Iroha.  I just wanted to introduce myself.  It’s so strange being in a new school."

Ada glared back at her hoping that she would take a hint and go away, but Iroha did not seem to notice.

"I mean, I’ve been to the States a few times before, and that was really fun.  I thought I knew what to expect and all that, but to actually be attending a class is so exciting!"

Ada increased the ferocity of her stare, but again, Iroha ignored it and kept on talking.

"Uncle said it really isn’t that exciting, but he doesn’t know what he’s talking about!  Like, I can’t believe how much different that class period was from my classes back in Japan.  And everybody here is so nice, I just can’t believe it!  Everywhere I look I just can't stop thinking about all the new people I get to meet.  I mean, maybe we could become friends, you know?"

Realizing that her tactic was not working, Ada assumed the blankest stare possible and began to slowly pack up her things.  Iroha did not notice.  She barely paid attention as she blabbered.  Her face and voice flitted between a vast spectrum of emotional movements and sounds: animated head bobs, cute pouts, wide eyes, knowing winks, wide grins…  Iroha had mastered the usage of them all.  It was really rather impressive, if Ada had to admit.

"Are there any other transfer students?  I’m only here because of Uncle, of course, but I can’t tell if a lot of people come here.  I’ve never been to Colorado before.  Do people visit often?  The mountains are so beautiful in the winter, oh my gosh."

With a final furtive glance at Iroha, Ada hefted her book bag, stood, and slowly backed away. Iroha did not notice immediately, and when she did, she simply turned to the nearest group of students and in the blink of an eye was now chatting with them.

Ada sighed and slumped against the wall near the door  It was always draining to deal with people like that.  It was best to say as far away as possible.  She needed that energy elsewhere, especially now.
