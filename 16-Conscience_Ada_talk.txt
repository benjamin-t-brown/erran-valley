For some reason, Ada could not find Conscience.  During Ada's practices, she typically spent her time either commenting on a perceived lack of effort from Ada, or else idling in the stands, complaining about how boring it was to just sit around.  However, on today of all days, when the impossible happens, she had taken it upon herself to vanish.  Ada was furious.

The front door burst open as Ada kicked it, stepping through and dumping her bags unceremoniously onto the floor.  Without bothering to pull off her coat, she kicked her shoes into the corner and stomped into the kitchen.  Here she found a familiar scene.

Mother sat in her reading chair, posture stiff as she frowned at Father, who's hands where spread wide on the counter, supporting his torso as he leaned aggressively forward.  They both looked sharply at Ada as she entered, abruptly stopping whatever argument they had been having.  Ada stopped too, regarding each of them.

Father broke the standoff.  He leaned back, rubbing his hands together, and a smile appeared on beneath his beard.  "Ah, welcome home, Adalais.  Mira and I were having a... discussion."

Mother crossed her legs and sniffed.

"But it's nothing," he continued.  "How was your day?"

Ada gave him a flat stare for a full second before responding.  "Good," she said, glibly.  "Nothing to report."

"That's it?" Father insisted.  "Come on, you've got to have something.  We don't send you to that expensive school so you can have boring days."  He was obviously just trying to use Ada to change the subject.

"Hmm," Ada thought, tapping her chin.  "Nope.  Nothing interesting happened."  She shrugged.

"Haven't you just come home from that training thing you're doing?  How did that go?"

"It went normally," Ada said.

"And that's good?"

"Yes."

"Nice."

"This is insufferable," Ada muttered under her breath.  She turned to Father.  "I am going to my room.  You may resume whatever discussion you were having.  It appeared riveting."  She turned on her heel and quickly stomped away so they could not stop her.  She distinctly heard Mother say "See what I mean?" as she opened and closed the door.  She did *not* slam it.  That would be uncouth.

Here, lounging on Ada's bed, one leg hanging off the side, was Conscience.  "Hey," she said.  "You seem in a good mood."

Ada narrowed her eyes.  "Where have you been?"

"Around," Conscience said.

"Fine.  Do not tell me."  Ada strode over to the chair at her desk and sat down.  She pulled off her socks and began massaging her feet.  They always ached so much after she ran.  The room was silent for several minutes.

Over at the bed, Conscience sighed and slipped easily off the bed.  She strode over to Ada and leaned on the desk, arms folded.  "Something felt odd about today."

Ada remained stubbornly silent.

"I'm not really sure what it was.  When you were practicing I just felt... restless.  So I got up and walked around."

Ada met her eyes.  "Restless?"

Conscience shrugged.  "Yeah.  Sorry I didn't tell you.  You were busy running though."

Ada nodded.  "Did you see what happened?"

"No." Conscience said, raising an eyebrow.  "What happened?"

So Ada told her, all about how Laurel had suddenly appeared, how she had found him in a heap on the ground and not recognized him at first.  How he agreed to train her.  When she talked about how Laurel was blind, Conscience interrupted.

"So that's why he stopped playing?"

"I suppose so."

Conscience bit her lip and tapped a toe on the carpet.  "What would make him want to train someone like you?"

"He said I had potential."

"That's my line," Conscience said.  "But I know you well."  She smirked.  "Too well."

"You do not appear to understand, Conscience.  Laurel said he would train me to play GDL.  This is... this is the greatest thing I could have ever hoped for!  I should be elated.  I should be excited!"

"But?" Conscience said. "You're not?"

"No," Ada said, looking through a gap in the blinds to the walkway outside.  A wind had picked up, tree's flapping, lamp poles rocking.  "I just feel..." she looked at Conscience.  "Restless."

Conscience nodded.  "I know what you mean."

They both fell silent at that.  The strong wind outside picked up intensity, rattling the wires hanging from the apartment complex's flagpole outside the window.  The leafless trees outside cast dancing shadows on the ground, and sometimes they flitted across the carpet in the room.  It seemed the weather too was restless.

"I think," Ada said, looking down at the floor, "that I may be worried Laurel's training will be more difficult than what I have been doing.  It certainly will not be easy, and I have already driven myself to near exhaustion and some injury trying to emulate him."  She looked to Conscience.  "Am I capable of much more?"

"Pfft," Conscience shook her head.  "You won't know until you try, so why worry about it?  You already know that you want to train."

"You make it sound so easy.  One does not simply stop worrying."

"It IS easy," she said, examining the nails on her left hand.  "You just have a fondness for making things difficult."

"I certainly do not!"

Conscience smirked.  "So are you gonna do it, or do you need me to remind you about how great you are again?"

"Of course I am going to do it!" Ada snapped, tilting her chin up. "I just thought you might want to know I shall be even more tired in the near future.  I will not have time to babysit you anymore."

Conscience seemed very amused by that, though she did not respond.

They settled into the normal evening where Ada tried to cram as much homework into an hour as possible.  Ada pulled a binder from her desk drawer and flicked on her laptop.  Conscience sat on the bed, idly swinging her legs, whistling softly through her teeth.  At one point she sighed, and spoke quietly, "what would you do without me?"

Ada pretended not to hear her.  She needed to focus on her homework.

The next day, Ada began her training.  After school ended she went down to the third field to find Laurel already waiting for her.  He sat by himself on a bench on the side of the field, hands clasped patiently.  He appeared pensive as Ada approached, and she had to tap him lightly on the shoulder to break him from his thoughts.

He spun towards her.  "Ada?"

"Yes."

He nodded and stood.  "Good.  Are you ready to start?"

"Yes."

"Alright then."

That was it.  No fanfare.  No introduction.

What commenced was the hardest physical activity Ada had ever done in her life.  Laurel brought her through a seemingly endless list of various motions and exercises, many of which Ada had never done before, despite having observed and memorized Laurel's own practices.  She struggled heavily through them.   Even the ones she had been doing, she did not appear to perform them to the extent that he demanded.  He stand next to her and give terse instructions, and though he could not see her, he rattled off different things to correct so as to not form bad habits.  Correcting them often made the exercises much more difficult.  Every time he spoke he sounded disappointed.

After every set, it took Ada every last ounce of her strength and determination to stand up, wipe sweat from her eyes, and wait for Laurel to bark his next orders.  Her body screamed in protest.  Her legs wobbled.  It would end eventually.  She could not stop.  Not in front of Laurel.  That was unthinkable.  It was the one thing that kept her going.

"We're done," Laurel said.  His voice was hard, emotionless.

"Huh?"

"We're done," he repeated, louder.  "Training is over."  He put his hands in his pockets and turned away.  "I'll see you tomorrow.  Right here."  He walked off the field.

Ada stared dumbly after him for a moment before shaking herself and regaining her composure.  The sun was setting over the mountains in the west. She had been here for hours.  For a while there her mind had gone completely blank, and she had not registered time passing at all.  She could not recall much of the last part of it.  Her body did though.  It did not seem to want to move.  She had to will herself to where her bag lay and don her shoes so she could begin the grueling walk home.
