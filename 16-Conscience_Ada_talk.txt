For some reason, Ada could not find Conscience.  During Ada's practices, she typically spent her time either commenting on a perceived lack of effort from Ada, or else idling in the stands, complaining about how boring it was to just sit around.  However, on today of all days, when the impossible happens, she had taken it upon herself to vanish.  Ada was furious.

The front door burst open as Ada kicked it, stepping through and dumping her bags unceremoniously onto the floor.  Without bothering to pull off her coat, she kicked her shoes into the corner and stomped into the kitchen.  Here she found a familiar scene.

Mother sat in her reading chair, posture stiff as she frowned at Father, who's hands where spread wide, supporting him as he leaned aggressively forward on the island.  They both looked sharply at Ada as she entered, abruptly stopping whatever argument they had been having.  Ada stopped too, regarding each of them.

Father broke the standoff.  He leaned back, rubbing his hands together, and a smile appeared on beneath his beard.  "Ah, welcome home, Adalais.  Mira and I were having a... discussion."

Mother crossed her legs and sniffed.

"But it's nothing," he continued.  "How was your day."

Ada gave him a flat stare for a second before responding.  "Good," she said.  "Nothing to report."

"That's it?" Father insisted.  "Come on, you've got to have something.  We don't send you to that expensive school so you can have boring days."  He was obviously just trying to use Ada to change the subject.

"Hmm," Ada thought, tapping her chin.  "Nope.  Nothing interesting happened."  She shrugged.

"Haven't you just come home from that training thing you're doing?  How did that go?"

"It went normally," Ada said.

"And that's good?"

"Yes."

"Nice."

"This is insufferable," Ada muttered under her breath.  She turned to Father.  "I am going to my room.  You may resume whatever discussion you were having.  It appeared riveting."  She turned on her heel and quickly stomped away so they could not stop her.  She distinctly heard Mother say "See what I mean?" as she opened and closed the door.  She did *not* slam it.  That would be uncouth.

Here, lounging on Ada's bed, one leg hanging off the side, was Conscience.  "Hey," she said.  "You seem in a good mood."

Ada narrowed her eyes.  "Where have you been?"

"Around," Conscience said.

"Fine.  Do not tell me."  Ada strode over to the chair at her desk and sat down.  She pulled off her socks and began massaging her feet.  They always ached so much after she ran.  The room was silent for several minutes.

Over at the bed, Conscience sighed and slipped easily off the bed.  She strode over to Ada and leaned on the desk, arms folded.  "Something felt odd about today."

Ada remained stubbornly silent.

"I'm not really sure what it was.  When you were practicing I just felt... restless.  So I got up and walked around."

Ada met her eyes.  "Restless?"

Conscience shrugged.  "Yeah.  Sorry I didn't tell you.  You were busy running though."

Ada nodded.  "Did you see what happened?"

"No?" Conscience said, raising an eyebrow.

So Ada told her, all about how Laurel had suddenly appeared, how she had found him in a heap on the ground and not recognized him at first.  How he agreed to train her.  When she talked about how Laurel was blind, Conscience interrupted.

"So that's why he stopped playing?"

"I suppose so."

Conscience bit her lip and tapped a toe on the carpet.  "What would make him want to train someone like you?"

"He said I had potential."

"That's my line," Conscience said.  "But I know you well."  She smirked.  "Too well."

"You do not appear to understand, Conscience.  Proud said he would train me to play GDL.  This is... this is the greatest thing I could have ever hoped for!  I should be elated.  I should be excited."

"But," Conscience said, "I assume you're not?"

"No," Ada said, looking through a gap in the blinds to the walkway outside.  A wind had picked up, tree's flapping, lamp poles rocking.  "I just feel..." she looked at Conscience.  "Restless."

"Ah.  I know what you mean."

They both fell silent at that.  The strong wind outside rattled a flagpole, the wires pinging on the metal at short intervals.

"So are you gonna do it?" Conscience asked.

"Train with Laurel?  Of course I am."

"So then is there really a problem?"

Ada let out a breath.  "Not yet."
