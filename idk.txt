Trickles of rain water meandered their way across lumpy asphalt to the cracked and chunked concrete gutter at the mouth of the alley.  Their trails reflected the dim light of a flickering street lamp, providing the only sort illumination around for the surrounding street and office buildings.  Every so often, a lone car would turn onto the cross street nearly two football fields up the road, and chug its way past the alleyway, the inhabitants only revealed for the briefest moment, their blaze' silhouettes focused on the road in front of them.  The rainwater from their tires splashed onto the sidewalk in little arcs, obstructed by the posts of signs swinging with the gusts that came with a light storm.

Huddled beneath the outcropped fire escape of a second-story apartment, Jesse gazed intently towards to her right, at the mouth of the alley.  The hood of her sweatshirt was pulled tightly over her forehead, but that did not stop locks of her hair from blowing into her face, dampening with the moist air.  In her hands she clutched a small bag, held carefully to her stomach to protect it from the water.  Despite her shelter, she was thoroughly soaked, her jeans and sleeves dripping water at alternating intervals.  Shivers occasionally came upon her, but she kept her eyes focus on that alleyway.

Someone appeared there; a hulking man, shoulders broad, nearly six and a half feet tall, walking slowly through the rain.  As soon as Jesse saw him, she tensed, pulling the package tighter.  The man strode towards the sign and stopped, tapping it lightly with a wet knuckle.  Jesse gathered herself and stepped out.
