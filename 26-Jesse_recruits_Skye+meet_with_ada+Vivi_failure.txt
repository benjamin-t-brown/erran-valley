Jesse felt focused, and that was a very good thing.

Having spent the past few weeks in a constant persevering drift, only able to react to the twists and turns that her tumbling life threw at her, she had been restless, frustrated, and above all, tired.  Very tired.  A bone-weary fatigue had begun to take root, exacerbated by nightmare-ridden nights and constant anxiety.  However, that tiredness that had threatened to engulf her had all but vanished now.  Sometimes a person needed a particularly interesting puzzle to solve to jump start their energy, and Jesse had found her puzzle in Adalais Eldridge.

Jesse could see a lot of herself in the girl: that stubborn pride was certainly familiar.  Also that grim determination.  But something about the way she acted made Jesse think that her persona was all a front.  Jesse noticed subtle things, like the way she constantly seemed to avert her eyes in conversation, or how she always seemed to be talking with somebody who was not there.  There was something up with her, Jesse was certain, and Jesse very badly wanted to help her with it.  There were not many people towards whom Jesse felt this sort of natural gravitation, but Ada - strange, stubborn Ada - was absolutely one of them.

She popped out of her daydream after completely bumping into Skye at her locker.

"Careful!" Skye said, as Jesse staggered backwards.  She almost fell. One hand on her locker door, the other holding a tattered book, Skye stood still, frowning.  "You okay?"

"Yeah," Jesse said, straightening.  Skye had not even moved an inch, and Jesse had almost toppled over!  She was really quite sturdy.  "Sorry."

"Cool."  She slammed the locker door.  It didn't close fully, a sleeve of a bulky purple winter coat poking out the side.  Skye noticed and kicked the door.  It clicked, and Skye nodded.

"Hey," Jesse said.  "You play GDL right?"

"Yeah," Skye said.  "Who wants to know?"

"Do you have any interest in joining a team?"

Skye folded her arms.  "What team?  You talking about the school team?"

Jesse shook her head.  "A different one."

"Yeah?"

"Could you meet me on the roof at lunchtime?"

"The roof?  Sure."

Jesse nodded.  "Okay then."  Well... that was easy.

--

It was rather shocking for Jesse to see that Ada had beat her up to the roof.  The room for her last class was right next the stairwell that led up here, and she had wasted no time after the bell rung.  However, it was much more shocking to see that she had brought somebody with her. Jesse's eyes narrowed as she noticed who it was. The short-haired, piano-playing transfer student Iroha stood beside Ada, her hands on the rickety metal railing, leaning way out over and at the ground three stories down.  Ada spotted Jesse as the door to the roof closed, though she gave a tight-lipped glance at Iroha before speaking.

"Good, you are here."

"Oh!"  Startled, Iroha righted herself on the railing and spun, her earrings dangling about her face.  "Excuse me!"  She drew a finger threw her hair and smiled uneasily.

Ada was pointedly not looking her.  As Jesse walked over, she spoke in a tight voice. "I have found another student who is interested in the team."   Her jaw was unnaturally clenched, and she appeared to be forcing the words out.

"Iroha...?" Jesse whispered, disbelieving.

Ada raised en eyebrow.  "Do you know her?"

With a frown, Jesse turned to Iroha, studying her.  The girl nervously glanced from Ada to Jesse, smile somewhat faltering as she smoothed her skirt and bit her lip - although, she bounced excitably on her heels.  Her frown deepened.  She had several questions... however, first things first.

"I've also recruited a player."  She indicated the door.  "Should be here soon."

Right on queue, Skye busted open the door.  "Hello?" she called, striding onto the roof.  "Jesse?"  It took her a moment, but she eventually spotted the three of them and nodded to herself.  She walked over and joined the group.

Maybe it was the present company of two freshmen girls with whom she stood, but for the first time, Jesse really noticed Skye's size.  Jesse herself was tall for a girl and had never really noticed the relatively small height difference between them, but seeing Skye standing next to these two, nearly a head and a half taller than each, and certainly twice as thick... it was quite noticeable, especially in the way both of them tilted their heads back to look up at her.

"I remember you," Ada said as Skye approached.  "You were at Rex arena the other day."

Jesse blinked.  Ada knew Skye?

"Rex...?" Skye appeared dumbfounded for a moment, then recognition lit her face.  "Oh yeah!" She grinned.  "You're that girl who almost clocked Lachlan!"  She chuckled.  "I like your style."  She held out a hand.  "I'm Skye."

"Yes... well," Ada colored.  She held out a hand.  "Ada."

As they shook, Iroha tiptoed around Skye and planted herself in front of Jesse.  "I'm Iroha," she said, holding out a hand, eyes glistening.  Jesse took it.  The grasp was much firmer than she had anticipated, and she almost winced.  "Jesse."

Ada cleared her throat.  "I see you are interested in joining the team."

"Maybe."  Skye surveyed the group skeptically.  "You guys any good?"

Without missing a beat, Ada said, "We will be."  She spoke in such a monotone, brisk voice that it seemed a foregone conclusion, and with Ada, it probably was.

Skye folded her arms.  "Have you guys even played?"

"I am trying to FORM a team," Ada said, hands on hips.  "A serious team.  This is not some recreational activity, nor some kind of extracurricular hobby..." Her eyes flashed.  "I intend to be successful.  I intend to win."

Beside Jesse, Iroha's eyes were large and she clutched at her skirt.  "Finally," she whispered.  She sniffed and turned her head, wiping her eyes.

Ada looked over at her.  "Are you... okay?"

"Yes," Iroha said with another sniffle.  Abruptly she ran up to Ada and grabbed her in what looked like an uncomfortably tight hug.  Ada tried to push her away, but Iroha only hugged harder.  "I've been looking for somebody like this for so long!  You have no idea."  After an awkwardly long time, she let go and did not seem to notice the repulsive expression on a ruffled-looking Ada.  "So can I join!  When do practices start!"

"Would you stop doing that!" Ada snapped, brushing of her blouse and fixing her ponytail.  "I told you to calm down."

Jesse snickered.  She was beginning to like Iroha quite a lot.

Ada made a vexed sound, glaring at Jesse, but she turned to Skye and spoke.  "As for practices, we still need to decide.  There is not enough time right now, so we will have to meet again to figure that out."

"Alright," Skye said, rubbing her chin.  "Where?"

Jesse stepped forward.  "We'll have to get back to you on that," she said.  She glanced at Ada who had been about to respond.  Ada fell back, raising an eyebrow.  "We still need to recruit another member."  She held up a hand.  "We need five, right?"

"Yes..." Ada said slowly.  "If the four of us are playing?" She looked around.  Iroha nodded back eagerly, and Skye shrugged.

"I might have a fifth," Jesse said.

"Do I know her?" Skye asked.

"I'd be quite shocked if you did."  Although, plenty of that had gone around today.
