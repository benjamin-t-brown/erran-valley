Jesse felt focused, and that was a very good thing.

Having spent the past few weeks in a constant persevering drift, only able to react to the twists and turns that her tumbling life threw at her, she had been restless, frustrated, and above all, tired.  Very tired.  A bone-weary fatigue had begun to take root, exacerbated by nightmare-ridden nights and constant anxiety.  However, that tiredness that had threatened to engulf her had all but vanished now.  Sometimes a person needed a particularly interesting puzzle to solve to jump start their energy, and Jesse had found her puzzle in Adalais Eldridge.

Jesse could see a lot of herself in the girl: that stubborn pride was certainly familiar.  Also that grim determination.  But something about the way she acted made Jesse think that her persona was all a front.  Jesse noticed subtle things, like the way she constantly seemed to avert her eyes in conversation, or how she always seemed to be talking with somebody who was not there.  There was something up with her, Jesse was certain, and Jesse very badly wanted to help her with it.  There were not many people towards whom Jesse felt this sort of natural gravitation, but Ada - strange, stubborn Ada - was absolutely one of them.

She popped out of her daydream after completely bumping into Skye at her locker.

"Careful!" Skye said, as Jesse staggered backwards.  She almost fell. One hand on her locker door, the other holding a tattered book, Skye stood still, frowning.  "You okay?"

"Yeah," Jesse said, straightening.  Skye had not even moved an inch, and Jesse had almost toppled over!  She was really quite sturdy.  "Sorry."

"Cool."  She slammed the locker door.  It didn't close fully, a sleeve of a bulky purple winter coat poking out the side.  Skye noticed and kicked the door.  It clicked, and Skye nodded.

"Hey," Jesse said.  "You play GDL right?"

"Yeah," Skye said.  "Who wants to know?"

"Do you have any interest in joining a team?"

Skye folded her arms.  "What team?  You talking about the school team?"

Jesse shook her head.  "A different one."

"Yeah?"

"Could you meet me on the roof at lunchtime?"

"The roof?  Sure."

Jesse nodded.  "Okay then."

Skye waved as she left.  Well... that was easy.
