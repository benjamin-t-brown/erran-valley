Ada covered her mouth with a sweaty palm as the passing security guard swiveled his head from side to side.  He wore sunglasses, even though the sun had long since set, but that did not seem to inhibit him as he strode confidently down the concrete path that surrounded the stadium.  Ada's heart beat uncontrollably, and her other hand clenched hard around her elbow, the nails digging sharply into the skin.  He passed within feet of her hiding spot - behind a bush with thick green and red leaves that was just large enough for her small figure to fit behind.  The security guard did not notice her.  He strode away, down the path towards the parking lot.

On the other side of the path, Conscience popped her head out from behind a similar bush to Ada's.  She kept a watchful eye on the guard until he disappeared from sight, then turned and nodded to Ada.  They both crept back to the path, alert for other guards, though none came.

"Close one," Conscience whispered as they drew near enough together.

Ada could only nod back.  Her heart was still racing; she felt that if she opened her mouth, she would gasp inconveniently loudly for air.

Conscience pointed. "This way, right?"

They both turned their attention to the chain link fence that ran parallel to the concrete path, a few steps into the grass.  Slowly, Ada let out a long breath and tried to force herself to calm down.  It sort of worked.  She felt jittery still, but ready.  Well, readier than before.

With a quick glance at Conscience, Ada stepped up to the fence, grabbed a fistful of chains and quickly scrambled over the top.  She landed awkwardly on the grass on the other side, the top having snagged the tail end of her shirt, but she caught herself before she tripped on her face.  Turning around, she saw Conscience hesitating with one hand on the fence.

"Are you sure we should be doing this?" she asked from the other side, frowning through the links.

"Of course I am!" Ada snapped.  She gestured furtively at the ground beneath her feet.  "Just hurry up and get over here before that guard comes back!" 

Conscience sighed, but refrained from comment.  She leaped onto the fence and vaulted over to Ada's side, landing gracefully on the ground.  Ada barely gave her time to flick her ponytail behind her neck before grabbing her hand and pulling her along towards the stadium.

"You did not have to come," she muttered.

"You don't have to be so rough..." Conscience said.  She shook off Ada's hand, rubbing her wrist, and jogged to catch up with Ada.  "I'm just asking.  Seems like a lot of trouble."

"This IS worth the trouble," Ada whispered.  She walked up to the wall of the stadium and looked up.  Her eyes sparkled as she saw the sky and took in the view.  The night was lit up by multi-colored strobe lights dancing between the roof of the stadium, the nearby skyscrapers, and a few lazy clouds.  The low rumble of upbeat, synthetic music coming from inside echoed off the city buildings, the bass notes clearly audible despite the din of a crowd funneling their way through the ticket stalls a couple hundred feet away from Ada.  On the wall of the stadium in front of her, colorful banners tumbled down several feet, emblazoned with the decorative logos and eye-catching patterns of the two professional teams who would be playing a certain game here tonight: a game called GDL.

GDL stood for Gordon Distinguished League.  In essence it was an Esport â€“ a video game that people played against each other competitively.  The acronym came from billionaire software engineer Arguente Gordon, famous for his numerous inventions and machinations with respect to the virtual reality.  GDL was a game he had designed himself, and from the beginning it was intended to be a competitive sport played in virtual space.  However unlike most traditional video games which made use of a computer interfaced with some kind of controller, GDL required players to 'physically' enter the virtual world through a rig called a Capsule.  A player would enter a Capsule, strap themselves into a set of sensors, and then through a very complex simulation, that player could then move in the Capsule, and the Capsule would match their movements to the corresponding character inside the game.  The interface supported a full biological range of motion: a player could walk, run, jump, stretch, throw, leap, fall... All these actions and more could be simulated by the Capsule and reflected in the game world.  From outside, the Capsule was rigged up to an intricate set of cabling that allowed it to physically move around a constrained three-dimensional space: the cubic area of three times its size.  It used this space to further simulate what the player was doing inside.  For example, when walking, the Capsule moved slightly on the x and y axis to imitate a treadmill; when jumping, the Capsuled moved along the z axis and cushioned the fall at very precise timing.  The Capsuled was programmed with all sorts of little tricks like this to make the player inside really feel like they were navigating physically through a virtual world.  The technology was truly astounding.

Ada had not the faintest idea how it worked, and had never been inside a Capsule, but she was absolutely obsessed with the game, and more specifically, the sport.  She spent almost every waking hour of the day contemplating GDL.  Her room at home was adorned from wall to wall with pictures of professional GDL players, pennants, and other sports paraphernalia.  She had bookshelves lined with notebooks filled from beginning to end with dossiers of different teams' players, analysis of their general tactics, and notes on their potential weaknesses.  She had twelve tee shirts for the twelve different teams in the western North American division.  

Something about the game was just so fascinating.  The way somebody could go to a virtual world and practically physically 'be' there...  It was just incredible!  And further, it was simply incredible to watch how some of the players of this Esport simply moved.  They did not seem like real people; more like godlike figures, myths, legends.  How did they do it?  Was she capable of that one day?

She could not find out yet though.  To enter a Capsule, you needed to be fourteen years of age.  She had a few years to go before that time would come.  A rather irksome limitation.

Conscience tapped her on the shoulder.  "Do you need me to go first?"

Ada flicked her eyes away from the sky to the wall of the stadium in front of her.  It was a mass of solid concrete that extended four stories tall.  However, the bricks used to construct the outside wall were chiseled with a pattern that was surprisingly easy to grasp.  This made it very easy to climb.  She had first noticed this aspect of the wall on a visit to this stadium a few months ago, when Father had taken her along to see a hockey game here with several of his co-workers.  Well, actually, Conscience had pointed it out -- She was observant like that.  But an idea had struck Ada, and halfway through the game she had snuck away from the group and gone to find out how feasible of an access point to the building it was.  As it turned out, it was quite workable.  Quite workable indeed.

"Just follow me," Ada said.

Fixing her gaze at a shady portion of the wall, between two rows of lights that shone brightly toward the dome at the top, Ada identified the spot she intended to climb up to.  She glanced around, checking that nobody was walking along the concrete path they had crossed.  Nobody was.  She firmly affixed her hands to the wall, and began her climb.

The concrete felt rough beneath her hands, and more than a little damp.  She concentrated on one foothold at a time, one grasp at a time, pulling herself up smoothly and steadily, never pausing to look down.  Even still, butterflies flitted about her stomach.  On the wall, rising ever higher, the safety of the ground quickly began to fade.  If she fell from such a height...  She anchored her hand on a nearby outcropping and steadied herself with a foot on another.  Sweat began to cover her brow as she climbed, and her breath came in ragged huffs and puffs.  A few feet below Ada, Conscience followed up the wall, easily keeping up with Ada's pace.

Finally Ada stretched out and grasped a metal platform jutting out from the wall, almost completely obscured by a synthetic advertisement banner in front of it.  She scrambled onto this platform and helped pull Conscience up.  They both leaned back against the solid concrete wall to regain their breath.  Well, Ada was recovering at least.  She wiped sweat from her forehead and pushed some strands of hear out of her eyes.  Conscience appeared completely at ease, peering down the wall at the distance they had climbed.  Ada felt a pang of jealousy.  This was hardly fair!  What gave her the right to make that climb appear so effortless?

After some time, Ada put her hands on her knees and stood, preparing to continue, but Conscience grasped her wrist.  It seemed that she still wanted to protest.

"So I get that maybe seeing this for real might be a different experience than watching it on a screen, but couldn't we have at least tried to do this legally?  Maybe we could have, I don't know, bought tickets and walked through the gate?"

Ada brushed off Conscience's hand.  "You know as well as I that I do not have any money.  I do not have an allowance.  And that is not even mentioning the fact that the tickets are prohibitively expensive."

"Yes, but Mother might have given you--"

Ada cut her off.  "She most certainly would not have given me even a cent if I told her what it was I would be doing with her money."  Aside from having a particularly tight grip on her wallet, Mother also detested the sport of GDL.  To even bring it up in her presence was cause for grounding.  Ada suspected that the only reason she hated the sport so much was because Ada liked it so much.  The sentiment was classic Mother.

Conscience, of course, knew this.  Rarely did Ada not have issues with her parents, and Conscience had listened patiently on many occasions while Ada ranted about the particularly egregious examples of their idiocy.  But tonight that patience had been replaced with a particularly staunch reluctance.  It was beginning to get on Ada's nervers.

Conscience closed her eyes and took a breath.  "I suppose you won't back down will you?"

"Of course not."

"So stubbornâ€¦"

She pounded the ground lightly with a fist and abruptly bounced up. "So be it," she said with a sigh.

Ada raised a skeptical eyebrow at her before turning and pointing behind them.

A month ago, she had acquired the blueprints for the stadium - a trivial task, for they were publicly available on a .gov site -  and she had poured over them incessantly.  This had proven extremely valuable.  The metal platform on which they stood held a beam that ran into the stadium's main structure where it supported rows upon rows of steel columns beneath the third deck of seating.  Another smaller beam below stretched from the platform and well into the area below the stadium seating.  Its location and orientation provided the crux of Ada's infiltration plan.  This particular beam had been placed just low enough that she could balance herself out towards it, then climb into the small rampart between the beam above it, providing a path that led directly inside.  Well, inside the stadium at least.  It did not have direct access to seating.

She knelt down and began to slowly shimmy herself across the foot wide beam.  She had considered walking on it, but there was absolutely nothing to hold on to save for the beam itself, and she did not feel particularly confident in her ability to remain balanced.  Slowly but surely, Ada made her way across it to a little lip where she pulled herself into a small hole beneath the bleachers.  Stomach flat on another metal beam, she crawled forward one elbow at a time.  She heard Conscience's grunts behind her.

"Almost there," she muttered to herself.  She looked up, to a light at the end.  She just had to get there.  Just a bit further...

Squeezing through a very tight opening, scraping her shins quite painfully, Ada suddenly found herself in a nook beneath two billboards, where she could sit and look out onto the field.  Her jaw dropped.  It was everything she had ever dreamed of and more.  She stared out from a vantage just above the press box with a full view of the pitch below and the massive screen projected TV at the far end of the stadium.  She could see everything, from the complex rigging of the pitch, to the Capsules and the banners that the crowd held up.  People filled the stands, most wearing the colors of Team Umbra: black jerseys slashed with purple and pink ribbons around the sleeves.  They held signs, sported painted faces, and giggled excitedly at the match to come.  None of them so much as glanced up at the little alcove in which she sat.

Conscience emerged noisily from the crevice behind her, plopping onto the metal beam with a grunt, and panicked as she nearly tumbled off the edge.  Ada caught her and safely pulled her in to sit in the spot beside her.  Conscience's breath had quickened, and she held a hand over her heart, but here eyes widened as she surveyed the view of the field that they both now had.

"Wow," she said quietly.  "This is quite a good seat for an illegal entrance."

"Indeed," Ada said smugly.  Weeks of planning had culminated in this moment.  She appreciated the confirmation of her intelligence.

They ogled at the view for a few minutes, Ada intentionally attempting to imprint the moment permanently in her memory, though it was not something she was liable to forget.  She had been to other professional sports games with Mother and Father before, but she had never been this excited about being at a stadium.  She felt more a part of the match than she ever had sitting alone in her room at 2 AM, curled up on her bed, phone held in front of her face as she watched round after round of GDL.   It had a different feel when she truly cared about the game itself, and the teams.

Conscience suddenly turned towards her.  "So what's all this for anyway?  Why are you so determined to be here?"

Ada arched an eyebrow, but did not respond immediately.  To explain this for somebody like Conscienceâ€¦ well she suspected to fully explain it would not be possible.  This game meant more to Ada than practically anything else in the world.  How could she hope to make Conscience understand that?

The screen across the stadium had been showing pictures and profiles of the members of each team that would be playing tonight.  They were all young men, some spindly, some muscular, but all fit and confident.  At that moment the screen transitioned to a player, a young man who appeared like the rest, tall and handsome.  The text beneath his picture said 'Laurel "Proud" Gawin.â€™  On the next line: â€˜Scout, Tyzonâ€™s Team Victory.  His team's logo blazed behind him: a large, snake-like letter 'V' superimposed an another capital 'T'.  The background showed a red stripe fading into the white-laquered lettering.  Ada caught herself staring at him, and quickly adjusted her headlamp, looking around at the stands.  Several members of the audience pointed to the screen excitedly, and the buzz of they made became noticeably more vibrant.

"It is not just the game I came here to see, Conscience.  I came here to see him."

Below them, the press box began their broadcast.

-

The broadcast booth's setup was rather standard: two men dressed in ties and long-sleeved Oxford shirts sat behind a sleek desk, the roaring crowd behind them fueling their apparent passion for the game they were about the watch.

Of the two men, the one on the left, the play-by-play commentator, was short, stalky, and bald, the polished skin on his head sometimes reflecting into the camera on his profile.  His cohort, a much taller and lanky man, elicited a more relaxed approach to his job.  Where the play-by-play commentator on the left looked about ready to burst with excitement, the color-commentator on the right seemed pleasantly calm and ready for the broadcast.

They began their segment, Ada and Conscience above them able to hear everything they said.

"Hello everyone, and welcome to another match of Gordon Distinguished League here in the wonderful city of Denver, Colorado!"  The bald man on the left said enthusiastically.  "I'm Phillip 'Hijinx' McGee and I'm lucky to be joined by my co-caster Anders "Smalltail" McFadden..." the man to his right waved and smiled, "who you may remember was the very talented front-runner for Team Lava Corps just two years ago."

Smalltail, having been formally introduced, continued right where Hijinx left off.  "Thanks 'Jinx, and speaking of being lucky, we are in for a treat tonight, as we will be seeing a match between two contenders for a spot in the North American Worlds Qualifiers."

The broadcast had now switched to an overlay, but it shown on the screens directly in front of the commentators: A picture of both the competing teams' emblems, one a picture of a massive "V" for Tyzonâ€™s Team Victory, and the other, blocked and shadowed letters for the team owned by Umbra Static Corp.

The bald man, Hijinx, was now speaking: "That's right Smalltail, but before we stick our feet into the action, let's take a look at the matchup."  The commentators' screens lit up with a table of win/loss comparisons for a division of teams.  "A win tonight for either team will grant entrance to the world qualification final in Massachusetts.  The loser?  Well they'll have to wait another whole year before they have another chance to play on the world stage.  With so much on the line, Smalltail, which team do you think has the edge in this contest?"

Smalltail did responded quickly. "Well, Tyzon is the talk of the town right now. They are one of the newest additions to the league, but from their very first match they have taken North America by storm.  They smashed their way through the amateur circuit last year without dropping a match, and living up to their name, have thus far not lost one in the professional circuit.

"Right you are, Smalltail," said Hijinx.  "Tyzon has indeed looked utterly unstoppable since they joined the league.  But whatâ€™s the secret to their success?"

"Well how can you talk about Tyzon without talking about their prodigy player and front-runner 'Proud'." A picture of the same man who had been on the projection popped up onto the commentator screens.  "This young man has astonished critics and coaches alike with his incredible control of his Capsule.  He is developing quite a fan base, and not just here in America, but all over the world."  The little production screen that reflected what the live broadcast saw was now overlayed with a slideshow of fans in Tyzon paraphernalia, smiling and waving at the camera.  Smalltail paused for emphasis at this point.  "Tyzon have got a special player in Proud.  I've seen a powerful presence from him and his team in this league for a while now, and I think they have the best shot not only to win this match, but also the World Stage.  My vote is for Tyzon."

Hijinx decided to play devil's advocate: "Hey, now this is a team game, Smalltail.  It takes more than one to win." He gave a fake admonishing grin to his co-caster.  "Let's not count out the seeded favorites for this game.  Umbra Static may not have such a prodigic player as Proud, but the Umbra organization itself has a storied and medal-checkered past.  They have never failed to attend the world stage â€“ with a streak of four years I might add.  They have a host of solid players with Kormander and Legion both at the top of their game right now.  Tyzon has done very well so far but they havenâ€™t tested their strength against a veteran giant like Umbra Static."

Smalltail shook his head, "While that is certainly impressive, one streak has to end tonight.  I say Umbra Static goes home and waits for the next year.  Itâ€™s time to see Proud shine."

Ready to wrap up, Hijinx looked back at the camera. "Some confident words, Smalltail, and we will certainly see if you are correct, but right now we'll be heading to a brief commercial break.  Don't go anywhere folks, we'll be right back."

-

As the casters finished their segment, Conscience turned to Ada.  "Well heâ€™s rather handsome, isnâ€™t he?  I can see why you like him."

"I do not want to see him because he is handsome," Ada said, attempting to force the flush in her cheeks to recede.  "I want to see him because he is the *best*."  It was not working.  She was sure her cheeks were redder than the brightest rose.  She sighed..  "You could say he isâ€¦ inspiring to me," she muttered.

"Oh?  And, pray tell, how is that?"

Ada frowned down at the field.  "I feel that I... know him somehow."

"You do?" Conscience asked incredulously. She shook her head.  "I'm pretty sure I would have known about a guy like that.  You haven't spoken to me about him, save for tonight--"  She cut herself off, abruptly seeming to realize something.  "Oh I see!  It's like that isn't it?  I can totally understand why you wouldn't want to talk to me about your crushes..."

Ada put a hand to her temples, wincing.  "No, Conscience.  He has simply been something on my mind recently.  You are never interested when I watch GDL streams, so I figured you would not have an interest in him."

"Hmm," Conscience said, putting her hands behind her head and leaning back.  She almost whistled.  "I suppose that makes some sense.  But now I'm just curious.  Why do you feel like you know him?"

"I have seen him in person."

Conscience burst out laughing.  "That's all it takes?  One look and you're buddy-buddy now?  Is this true love at first sight?"

Eyes closed, Ada calmly waited for Conscience to stop giggling.  "You have the wrong idea," she said after several long, unpleasant seconds.  "I thinkâ€¦ he used to live near our house.  I used to see him every day."

"Oh..." Conscience said, eyebrows shooting up, disappearing beneath her long bangs.  "Explain.  Now."

"This was a while ago... a few summers perhaps.  Before I met you."  She gave Conscience a significant look, who nodded impatiently.  "Mother sent me to high school prep courses on weekday evenings.  She wanted to make sure I got into Erran Valley, so she sent me to these horrifically boring sessions at the school during summer break."  Ada shook her head in disgust.  "As if I would have a problem passing an examâ€¦ But Mother was insistent, and I did not feel like upsetting her."

"I see that tune has changed," said Conscience dryly.

"It was different back then," Ada said, waving her hand in front of her face.  "Mother was more tolerable.  But that is not the point. When I walked to school on these evenings, there was a boy there, on the fields furthest from the school.  I only noticed him because he was there every single time I passed by.  Running around, working hard on the field, he was always doing some movement or another.  His efforts looked truly exhausting, but he was always there, from the beginning of my classes, and past the end of them.  He did not miss a single day."

"Did you ever go up and talk to him?"

"Of course not!" Ada said, affronted.  "To me he was just some guy.  I had know idea who he was!  But... look at him now."  Ada trailed off, looking down at the field.  

"How did you know it was him?  This 'Proud' guy?" Conscience asked.

"One day, he just stopped coming, and I never saw him again.  I thought, maybe he had given up at whatever it was that he had been training for.  Then I saw him as the centerpiece for Tyzon.  It is unmistakably him, Conscience.  I never guessed he had been training for something like GDL.  He was so diligent, so disciplined... I have since wondered if I had the resolve to train in anything as devotedly as that."

She looked up to see shock on Conscience's face.  "Oh my..." Conscience said, "You really do have a crush on him..."

Ada gave Conscience her most withering look and quickly turned back to the field in order to hide that awfully embarrassing red in her face.  When Conscience was being particularly irritating, it was best to ignore her.

"This is so exciting!"  Conscience exclaimed.  "I've never seen you swoon like this!"

Ada stopped herself from retorting by clenching the metal beneath her.  She took a deep, calming breath.  "I am simply curious," she said, "how all that training is going to pay off."

"Right--" said Conscience, she opened her mouth to press yet further, but her next words were interrupted by the dimming of the stadium lights, and the hush of the crowd.  They both looked down to the field where cranes began to lift all ten of the Capsules off of their landings and onto the field.  Ada released her hands as adrenaline shot through her.

"So what exactly are we going to see?" Conscience asked in a hushed whisper.  "I assume this is some sort of sport?"

"Yes," Ada said, "It is a game where two teams of five players compete in a pre-generated virtual world."

"Okay..." said Conscience slowly, "so what do they do?"

"You will just have to see for yourself."
