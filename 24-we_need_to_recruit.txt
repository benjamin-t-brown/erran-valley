Ada slammed the door to her locker, firing a withering glare to some startled boys nearby.  Stooping to pick up the books on the floor, she muttered under her breath, "She has no right!"

"For what?"  Conscience asked.

"Everything!"

"Clearly she wants to talk," Conscience said, shrugging.  "Maybe she couldn't do it until later."

"If that deplorable girl wishes to speak with me, she can come seek me out.  I refuse to go to her domain."

Today, as she hung up her backpack, Ada had found a piece of paper hanging from the metal grill on the inside of the locker door.  A piece of paper that had been ripped into several pieces and scattered across the carpet; a result of Ada having read that Jesse wanted her to come to the roof at lunch time.

Adjusting up her books in her arms, Ada struck up a brisk walk.

Conscience persisted, running up beside her.  "Shouldn't you at least hear her out?"

"Why should I do that?  She is the one sneaking around my back.  Let her come out of the shadows for once."

"You're being unreasonable."

Ada rounded on her.

"And you are being annoying.  What do *you* care so much?  She isn't stalking you."

"You mean aside from the fact that you won't shut up about her?" she said, wryly.  After a warning look from Ada, Conscience sighed.  "I want to know more about Jesse.  I have a feeling there's more to her than you've judged.  I mean, why is she so interested in you?"

"Do not ask me why a hussy does what she does."

That rose an eyebrow on Conscience's face.  "You know, when you're this mad, you kind of scrunch your face... I think the boys would find you pretty cute."

"I am not cute!" Ada said, harshly.  A passing teacher gave Ada a very confused look.  Cheeks reddening, she upturned her chin and stalked away.

The sun blasted Ada's face as she pushed open the rusty door to the rooftop.  She squinted, shivering slightly at a chill breeze that wafted into the building.  When her eyes became accustomed to the brightness, she spotted the person she sought.  Jesse lounged on the ground nearby, back against a concrete wall, an elbow on her knee, clutching a small sandwich.

Ada took a small breath, then rounded on Conscience who stood quietly behind her.

"I am only doing this to stop your incessant nagging."

Conscience just shrugged, though she seemed pleased.  Without holding the door, Ada strode right up to Jesse and firmly planted her fists on her hips.

"What do you want?" she asked.

Unconcerned, Jesse took a bite.  "Sit down," she said, mouth full.  "I want to talk."

For response, Ada gave her a tried-and-true glare.

"Fine." She stuffed the sandwich in her mouth, rolled onto her heels and hopped up. "The ground's cold anyway."

This was a strange place to hold a conversation.  Aside from the fact that students were certainly not supposed to be up here, it was uncomfortably chilly, and the sounds of a city made a rumble loud enough one needed to speak just a bit louder than normal in order to be heard clearly.  Perhaps Jesse hoped this would put Ada off balance.  She, of course, was gravely mistaken.

Dusting off her skirt, Jesse finished chewing and swallowed.  "Seems like were going to be working together a lot."

Ada's eye twitched.  "Working together?"

"Yep!"  Her lips curled into an smile.  "Now that Laurel agreed to train me, we're going to be spending a lot of time together.  So I want to know more about you."  She shrugged.  "Who knows?  Maybe we could become friends." 

"I have no interest in that," Ada said.

"And why not?"

"Because you are not worth my time."

"Ouch," Jesse said, though that insufferable smile still lingered.  "
