Ada slammed the door to her locker, firing a withering glare to some startled boys nearby.  Stooping to pick up the books on the floor, she muttered under her breath, "She has no right!"

"For what?"  Conscience asked.

"Everything!"

"Clearly she wants to talk," Conscience said, shrugging.  "Maybe she couldn't do it until later."

"If that deplorable girl wishes to speak with me, she can come seek me out.  I refuse to go to her domain."

Today, as she hung up her backpack, Ada had found a piece of paper hanging from the metal grill on the inside of the locker door.  A piece of paper that had been ripped into several pieces and scattered across the carpet; a result of Ada having read that Jesse wanted her to come to the roof at lunch time.

Adjusting up her books in her arms, Ada struck up a brisk walk.

Conscience persisted, running up beside her.  "Shouldn't you at least hear her out?"

"Why should I do that?  She is the one sneaking around my back.  Let her come out of the shadows for once."

"You're being unreasonable."

Ada rounded on her.

"And you are being annoying.  What do *you* care so much?  She isn't stalking you."

"You mean aside from the fact that you won't shut up about her?" she said, wryly.  After a warning look from Ada, Conscience sighed.  "I want to know more about Jesse.  I have a feeling there's more to her than you've judged.  I mean, why is she so interested in you?"

"Do not ask me why a hussy does what she does."

That rose an eyebrow on Conscience's face.  "You know, when you're this made, I think the boys would find you pretty cute."

"I am not cute!" Ada said, harshly.  A passing teacher gave Ada a very confused look.  Cheeks reddening, she upturned her chin and stalked away.

Ada walked up to Jesse and firmly planted her fists on her hips.

"What do you want?"

Unconcerned, Jesse took a bite from her sandwich.  "Sit down," she said, mouth full.  "I want to talk."

"I am fine right here."

"Fine." She stuffed the sandwich in her mouth, rolled onto her heels and hopped up.  She took another bite and said, "The ground's cold anyway."  Ada tried to pretend she was not a half-head shorter than Jesse, but still had to look up slightly.  Dusting off her skirt, Jesse finished chewing and swallowed.  "So... I wanted to ask you a question."

"What question?"
