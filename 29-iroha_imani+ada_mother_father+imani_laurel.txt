A buzz in the speaker above Imani's head notified him that someone had recently entered through the front gates.  He glanced at the little wooden clock on his desk.  A bit past eight.  He shook his head, gave a tsk, and resumed reading the leather-bound book in his hands.  It was not exactly a journal, but it contained a vast amount of little notes and anecdotes and phrases that he considered worth remembering.  Well, at least at some point or another in his life.  He made it a habit to write things down, as short and succinct as possible, to give a little snapshot of his mindset.  Had he the time and patience, he certainly would have kept a full diary.  As it was, he fancied the idea just enough to maintain this little book.

His desk was situated in the library, one of his favorite rooms.  The room was cylindrical, situated in a tower on the eastern part of his grounds, just enough isolated from the hustle and bustle of the kitchens to be both remote, but also convenient.  For Imani, it was important to have a place to sit alone, to read, and to think.  These were all amplified by simply sitting inside this place, surrounded by circular shelves of books rising two stories tall.  They absorbed the chaotic sounds of the city, providing a perfect haven of serenity.  In addition, the quiet made it easy for Imani to hear anybody approaching the library.

Quick footsteps came upon his ears, quiet at first, then louder as they approached the sliding, wooden door, twelve feet tall, which led into the hallway outside.
