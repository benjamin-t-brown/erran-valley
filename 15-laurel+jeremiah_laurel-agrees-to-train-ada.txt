"The results of these tests are frustrating.  But not unhelpful.  They tell us that our approach - and what we thought we knew - needs to evolve."

The words of Jeremiah were meant to be thoughtful, placating, and maybe even hopeful, but Laurel could tell that he was concerned.  Very concerned.

They were both in the 14th floor of the Tyzon Tower; a prolific building, the tallest in the city, and projecting the massive, red "T" Tyzon logo that could be seen for miles.  The damp office in which they both sat, face to face, was not nearly so majestic.  Laurel had been here many times, and did not need his vision to feel that an overwhelmingly drab brownness, with uninspiring carpeting, bland wallpaper, and suffocating fluorescent lighting. The only furniture in the room was a bulky desk and two office chairs, both of which whined in protest if anyone so much as leaned an inch in any direction.  It was unlikely that Jeremiah had decided to adorn the place with so much as a picture of a tree since the last time Laurel sat in here.  The man preferred to stay out of his office, and only used it out of necessity.  Like, for example, when he needed to have a private conversation.

"Has anything changed?" Jeremiah asked. "Anything at all?"

"You've asked me that a hundred times," Laurel said.  "No.  Nothing has changed."

"I could use any little scrap of information you can give me.  Anything!  Wrack your brain and tell me something new."

Laurel grimaced.  "No.  I've already told everything."

This conversation had been inevitable from the moment that Laurel was cleared from the hospital ward.  In fact, he had not taken three steps out of the wing when a Tyzon security guard had given him a directive to meet Jeremiah in this office.  So Laurel had come up here.  There was little point in trying to avoid it: Jeremiah wished to speak of Cecilia, and so that was going to happen.

Jeremiah's chair squeaked as he leaned back.  "There's more to this than your vision, you know.  What if she doesn't come back this time?"

Maybe that would not be so bad.  Of course, Laurel's thoughts were his own.  For the moment.  "I've told you everything," he said.  "We've seen this cycle before.  Many times.  It isn't any different.  She will come back."

"You're awfully calm about this.  You know it means we have to restart AGAIN?"

"I am... resigned to that."

"No!" Jeremiah said, his chair snapping back.  "It is different!  It has to be!  We were prepared, even for even an event like this!"

"Ah yes," Laurel said, "I was wondering about that.  By your tone, I'm guessing that you didn't instigate this... you said 'event'?"  He pointed to his face.

"Of course I didn't do this!" Jeremiah snapped.  "Why would I try to put you in any danger?  If you died, I'd have little to work with."  Quite blunt, but Jeremiah was never one to beat around the bush.  "Plus we've already tried this type of instigation.  It was a complete failure."

"So then who was it?"

"That... is unimportant.  My prerogative is to discover why we can't keep that damn girl in your head.  Let somebody else figure out that Gordon's whole organization is corrupt."

Laurel did not say anything.  In a way he could understand Jeremiah's frustration.  They had been running this experiment with Cecilia for... what was it?  Nearly fifteen years now?  Tyzon was beginning to suspect more and more what was really happening here, and still, Jeremiah clung to the hope that he would solve this puzzle.  To figure out why, after all this time, Laurel could still not control the thing in his head.

Jeremiah gave a resigned sigh.  "You've given me less to go on than those tests."  Laurel heard the desk drawer open, and a rustling of papers. "We'll have to start again.  But this time," then the clacking of a clipboard on the desk, "I want to approach this from the source."

"Back to the list?" Laurel asked, raising an eyebrow.  "You really are desperate."

"Right now it's all I've got."

Laurel reached forward and felt for the clipboard.  He found it and pulled it towards him, tapping it with a finger.  "So you really believe one of these kids is connected to Cecilia in some way?"

"It is a possibility."

"It's wishful thinking," Laurel said.  "Every child born of a Tyzon employee between 13 and 15 years ago.  Quite a list."  Laurel flicked his thumb across the tens of sheets of printed names attached to the clipboard.

"It's something!"  Jeremiah's fist hit the table with more force than Laurel expected.  He dropped the clipboard.  "It's something, Laurel, and maybe it's a miracle, but I won't give up until I have exhausted EVERY possibility."

"I see," Laurel said.

"Just..." Jeremiah sighed.  "Just leave... for now.  I need to think.  But be ready to come in again if I have an idea."

"Right," Laurel said, standing.  He turned towards the door, but an idle thought struck him.  "So what happens if one of those kids is... related... to Cecilia?  What would you do with them?"

It took a moment for Jeremiah to respond, but when he did, his voice held a dangerous conviction.  "Whatever it takes."

---

A Tyzon employee met Laurel at the entrance to the tower and directed him to a car that was to take him to some temporary lodgings.  Though grateful for this, Laurel understood that the gesture did not come from any sense of responsibility on Tyzon's part.  Jeremiah just wanted to make sure Laurel stayed nearby so he could get summoned at a moment's notice.

The driver's name was Tobin.  He was an amicable-enough fellow, though quite talkative.  So far the ride had been filled with Tobin jabbering in quick succession about the usual small talk: his family, the weather, food.  After they passed a movie theater though, and a remorseful comment about Laurel not being able to watch them, Tobin revealed his particular interest in the thespian arts, spouting film buff vernacular, and critiquing the acting of people of which Laurel had never heard.

"...She is a very shrill singer though, so it makes sense they'd sick her in that role, right?"

"Yep," Laurel said.

"Right?  But I can't help but wonder if they should've gotten younger actress.  I mean, that part isn't too hard, and I'm sure with the right director..."

Laurel's conversations with Jeremiah always left him somewhat uncertain.  The man was clearly dedicated to his research, and willing to put a lot on the line to get results.  But sometimes Laurel belt unsettled by him.  Those last words from Jeremiah... they had been tinged with an unmistakable madness.  Laurel knew that Jeremiah fully meant what he said.  Truth be told, it disturbed him.

"...some say he's a method actor, but I don't believe it."

Laurel stayed quite for several minutes as Tobin prattled on.  He had no idea where his lodgings were to be after exiting the hospital, but it was unlikely that they would be too far away.  Jeremiah wanted him close.  Tobin said something that made Laurel's ears perk up.

"Did you say, Erran Valley?"

"Hmm?" Tobin said.  "Yeah, it's on the left here." He took turn a little sharply and Laurel's shoulder dug into the right door of the car.  "Did you go there or something?" 

Laurel chuckled.  "Not as a student."  He knew where he was headed: his old apartment.  The one he had used when preparing for his stint in GDL.  Of course they would stick him back here.  "I used to... train on one of the many fields they have."

"Oh yeah?  For what?"

"It's not important.  I was an athlete, of sorts.  I was there a while ago."

They came to a halt at a stoplight, and Tobin gave a thoughtful sigh.  "One of my nieces goes to Erran Valley.  It's a nice school.  Supposedly for the gifted and talented.  Hard to get into you know?"

"I wouldn't know about that," Laurel said.  "I just used their field.  An empty lot that never seemed to be occupied, down by some abandoned parking lot.  Nice field."  He remembered discovering that gem.  Having grown up with lumpy asphalt, weeds, and dandelions as acceptable running surfaces, he had been nothing short of awestruck with it.  An immaculate grass football field, with a perfect turf track around the edges, rigidly painted lines, and a full set of cones hung neatly on a nearby post.  It was an athlete's dream.  It had never been in use by the school, Erran Valley, probably because they had two others just like it on the opposite side of the grounds with a much better lot.  So it had just sat there, pristine, and unused.  Laurel would not have forgiven himself for neglecting something like that.

"You know, I think we're right next to that field now," Tobin said.  "Dirt parking lot next to it?  Kind of out of the way of the school?"

"Yeah, sounds right."

"It doesn't look as abandoned as you make it out."

"Oh yeah?" Laurel asked.  "Who's out there?"  Maybe Erran Valley High School had grown since last he was here.

"Well it looks like a student.  Some girl is just running around on it."

"Just one?"

"Yep."

"Weird."

Tobin eased the car forward as the stoplight turned green, and drove away.  They dropped the subject for the remainder of the ride, which was only a few minutes: Tobin took a few more turns, drove a few blocks, and they exited the car.

"It's all been prepared for you," Tobin said.  He stepped forward and put a key card in Laurel's hand.  "They tell me you've been here before, but I figure I should still ask: need help getting up there?"

"No thanks," Laurel said.  "I can manage."

"Alright.  There's one more thing though."  He put something else in Laurel's hand. It was a metallic box of some sort.  Laurel did not recognize it. "They told me to give that to you too.  Said you're supposed to keep it on your person at all times.  Something about logging data or something.  Sorry, I didn't ask.  Not my place, you know?"

"I see," Laurel said, feeling the box in his palm.  It felt surprisingly dense, and had a few bumps along the edges.  Clearly it had something to do with Cecilia, but Laurel had no idea what.  Jeremiah had not mentioned this.  Sometimes he could be mysterious like that.  For the sake of science, of course.

"Well, I'll see you around, Laurel," Tobin said.  "I'm on call for you in case you need to get around.  Just beep me when you need a car."

"Thank you, Tobin."

The car door opened, closed, and Tobin drove away.  Laurel turned to face the building at the foot of which he stood.  He could picture it easily: a nondescript apartment complex with a minimalist aesthetic, a little narrower than most buildings on the block, and only a few stories tall.  He fingered the key card in his hand, trying to decide if he was pleased about being back here.  On the one hand, he was familiar with the place, which went a long way for a man without his vision, but on the other hand, the place reminded him of a time when he felt hopeful for his future.  He knew better now.

He placed the metallic cube that Tobin had given him in his pocket and set off on that familiar route to the third field of Erran Valley, across blacktop streets and concrete walkways, a path he had not trodden for what felt like many years, but was in fact, only one.

--

The air felt exactly the same as it always had.  Clean, crisp, and light.  Laurel exhaled and for a brief moment felt quite peaceful.  He stood at the edge of the field, hands in pockets, relaxing his body and mind as much as possible. 

Just then, Cecilia came back.

It was more of a pang, a sharp pain in his head, and a vision of something... angry.  He doubled over, grabbing his temples and rubbing furiously.  It lasted only a few moments, but it left him breathless and aching.  He took some time to stand up straight and push the pain away.  If Jeremiah knew this was happening to him, Laurel wondered if he'd ever be let out of that ward.
