The dim light of an overcast morning provided the only illumination for the indoor atrium of Erran Valley High School.  Though somewhat dim, the light was adequate for the sparse sets of students who made their steady way into the building.  They threaded automatically between four, tall pillars, an arm span in diameter, which held up the massive skylight, as they continued on their way to their lockers.  They sorted themselves by year in the hallways beyond.  First and second years stayed on the first floor.  Third and fourth went up a flight of stairs to the second.  Beneath the third of these pillars, watching students backs as they strode by her, Jesse sat with crossed legs, her sketchpad on her lap.  It lay blank, as it had since she sat down earlier this morning.  She had intended to sketch the scene, but found that she held little motivation right now.  Something about today had felt just a little off, and for the past half hour she had sat with her chin in her palm trying to reason out what.  Nothing had came to mind, and she found that quite frustrating.

Of course she had another reason to be here.  School did not start for yet another half hour, but she had a mission today.  The list of students Arnold had given her consisted of nearly all students that she knew, or had met, or had worked with on some project or another.  In other words, they were known to her.  They were normal enough that she could quite honestly say they were of no interest to Arnold or whoever had set him upon this task.  That made her comfortable with relaying information about them; the thought that not a single one of them would be dragged into this mess.

But of that whole list, there was a single student who Jesse did not know.  A certain first year named "Adalais Eldridge."  Well, Jesse knew of her: the girl was infamous amongst the first-years for her haughty attitude and... well, bitchiness in general.  Jesse had seen it for herself, even after doubting Otis's assessment, but poking around the first-year hallways and listening to gossip had convinced her that the girl was unapproachable.  Some might say this made Adalais more predictable than others, so why was Jesse so antsy about her?  Well, Jesse knew all to well that a front like the one Adalais purveyed often hid something beneath it.  And that was... unsettling.  She needed to know more about her.

The problem was that Adalais was an unreasonable person; so unreasonable that a simple conversation with her seemed almost impossible.  So Jesse had decided to resort to espionage.  From this pillar, she could see the moment Adalais entered the building.  She could determine her first class, and then follow her after the first period.  A simple plan. As of yet though, Jesse had not seen Ada.  She knew how to recognize her: petite, with that odd sunflower she wore in her hair every day.  Quite distinct.  Very helpful.

The time neared closer and closer to the 7:30, the start of classes, and the frequency of students passing by Jesse increased.  She had abandoned all thoughts of sketching, the pencil hanging limply from her hand as she waited.  It had to be soon right?  Adalais did not seem like the type of student to be tardy.

Five minutes until classes started. Maybe today she was absent?  That would be unfortunate.  Perhaps a few more minutes, then she really had to go.

The last stragglers were making their way in, their backpacks bouncing up and down as they jogged to their lockers in the hopes of beating the clock.  One minute before the bell Rang. Jesse sighed and stood up.  What a waste of time that was.  And in all likelihood she'd have to do it again.  Maybe she should come up with a different plan.

Just as Jesse took her first step away from the pillar, Adalais Eldridge walked briskly past the column, face intent, backpack slung over her left arm, and a large duffel bag over her right.  She continued towards the first-year hallway, and Jesse noticed she had a slight limp in her left leg.  She frowned, but followed a little behind her, stopping at the edge of the hallway and peering down it.  Adalais quickly opened a locker in the first set, forth from the right - Jesse took mental note of this - then hung her backpack and that other bag inside, grabbed a pencil box and book, and walked not ten steps behind her into the math classroom.  As the door closed behind her, the loudspeakers played the start-of-class chime.

Jesse sighed again.  Of course.  Maybe Adalais had known Jesse would try to spy on her today and had done this on purpose.  That was stupid, and Jesse knew it.  Perhaps she deserved it.  Resigned to her tardiness, Jesse walked away.

As the day progressed Jesse began to build a picture of the girl.  Unsurprisingly Adalais's reputation had clearly spread among all the first-years.  Not a single one attempted to speak with her, and wherever she walked, groups of them made way, all attempting to ignore her as thoroughly as possible.  That was certainly expected, but Jesse noticed other things.  Adalais was very meticulous and very diligent, using second period's off hour to work on an assignment, then eating lunch for precisely ten minutes before gathering up her things and working on another assignment.  This puzzled Jesse.  Adalais seemed like a girl who would easily have her work done on time, so why did she need to work now.  Maybe she was getting ahead?  She supposed it did not matter.

And something else.  She seemed to... talk to herself sometimes.  Jesse was never close enough to catch what she was saying, but certainly her lips were moving.  Maybe that was a tic of hers?  More speculation.

The school day drew almost to a close, and true to her mannerisms, Adalais had apparently not spoken to a single other student for the entire day.  Jesse could not confirm this was true in the classroom, but she suspected it was true.  That thought fascinated Jesse, who had been interrupted almost fifteen people today, among them Otis, who wanted to know why she looked so furtive, Vivi, who wanted to eat lunch,  and Eva and Mildred who of course wanted to take Jesse shopping.  Jesse went out her way to avoid people, and still they found her and wanted to talk.  For Adalais to accomplish this with what appeared to be little to no effort felt... unfair.  Sad.  But also unfair.  Sometimes it was all she wanted, to be alone, but she could never find a place with the solitude she wanted.

It was 3:45.  The majority of students had either left the school or were engaged in some club activities - soccer players drilled on the topside field near the entrance of the school, cross-country runners jogged out towards the city of Denver in groups of two or three, some third-years kicking around a hacky-sack near the picnic benches beside the parking lot.  And Jesse leaned against gazebo beside the third parking lot, gazing out at the third field, where Adalais was now running sprints up and down.  A man sat on one of the benches beside the field, directing her. It was an odd site, that girl, running so intensely.  Her limp from this morning was gone, Jesse noticed.  Maybe she was ignoring it.
