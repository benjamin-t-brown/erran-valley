With a flick of his wrist, Imani turned the handle on the door to the basement and proceeded down the steps behind it.  The descent was further than one a typical house's basement - nearly four stories of stairs along a narrow hallway, although there was plenty of room for artwork and decorations to distract along the way.  Imani very much enjoyed maps, and it was here that he had decided to place some of his collection: from world maps, to house layouts and everything in between, their frames were aligned at exact two-meter intervals along each wall, illuminated by lamps fabricated in the shape of torches - not too gaudily of course; he did not want it to look like the passageway to a dungeon.  Just enough to give a certain, gravity.

Halfway down, the stairs themselves went from blue-gray carpeting to a sort of chalky slate, and the left wall opened to a well of space.  Imani idly ran his hand along the stone banister here, glancing down to the base of the staircase, where a man stood.

"Did I keep you long?" Imani said as his foot hit the tiled floor.

"No," Laurel replied, tersely.

"I'm surprised you found your way down here so quickly.  My guests sometimes have a tendency to get lost."

"Your butler was helpful."

Imani raised an eyebrow, "Was he?  I've had trouble with him playing pranks in the past."

He strode past Laurel, stopping at the base of a massive, metal door opposite the stairs.  Cylindrical and sharp, it more resembled the door to a bank vault than anything that should reside in a house.  Imani reached into his shirt and pulled out a key card, swiping it against a dim light on the wall.  A pleasant beep sounded, followed by a sequence of rapid clicks and clunks as the door rotated open.

"This way," Imani said, walking through, footsteps echoing in the vast DL arena beyond.

He made his way to the large table off to the side, pulling out the cushioned chair at the end, and sitting in it.  Laurel followed, occupying the chair on the opposite end of the table.

"Forgive my brashness," Imani said, "I don't entertain blind people very often, but it does not seem to affect your movement as much as I would have anticipated."

He shrugged.  "A little practice goes a long way."

"Speaking of," Imani said, reaching over to the little console with a touch screen embedded in the table.  He held a finger to the bottom right of the screen, sending a subtle white wave across it, and one by one, lights began to flicker on in the arena.  The Capsules themselves, having been laying dormant horizontally, rotated upwards and out towards their regular stations, hoisted by the thick cabling attached to the ends.  The whole process took nearly five minutes, and both Imani and Laurel waited patiently for the clank of the last one being set in place.

"So," Laurel said.  "Maybe we should talk about what we're going to do today."

"Yes, let's."  Settling into his chair, Imani told Laurel about his plans for the team.  It had always been a possibility for Iroha to ask him to coach a GDL team.  In fact it was surprising she hadn't asked sooner.  The plans of which he spoke to Laurel had been formulated months ago, everything prepared for this eventuality.  In truth he had always wanted to aid her.   Iroha had such passion that Imani simply could not refuse.   He spoiled Iroha - he knew that - but what else was an uncle supposed to do?

Laurel remained quiet as Imani spoke, nodding his head hear and there, sometimes shrugging, sometimes thoughtful.  He gave no objections, and neither did he ask about Imani's preparedness.  All he said when Imani fell silent was, "Seems like a good plan."

"I'm glad," Imani said.  He leaned back in his chair.  "I guess we wait for them to arrive then."

"Is this the place?"  Ada asked, shivering.

"I don't know." Conscience said.  "Looks like it might be."

They had come upon a metal gate, three times taller than Ada, and eight as wide.  It blocked a road that led between two white-plastered walls stretching many blocks into the city in each direction.  Whatever these walls blocked off could not be seen from where Ada stood, but it was certainly odd to find such a large, walled-off place situated very near the center of the city, nestled between a five-story office building, a brick warehouse, and a park.  The dot on Ada's phone marked her in the exact spot she was supposed to meet Iroha for the first team practice today.

Ada looked around.  There were not many people nearby, even in the park across the street.  It was a colder day than usual today, and the early Saturday morning did not entice most outside.  The occasional car or truck drove down the wet roads, making small troughs in the light dusting of snow that had accumulated on the street.

"I'm cold," Conscience complained.  "If this is the place, you should find a way inside."

Readying herself for an appropriately candid response, Ada suddenly spotted a figure sitting beside the wall.  Ada has missed her on first look: she was curled up tight, and her thin hoodie blended in the the wall, but she could not mistake that distinct blue hair ribbon.  "I believe that is Jesse's friend... Vivi...?"  She hesitated a moment, unsure if she wanted to speak with her.

Conscience shoved her forward.  "What are you waiting for!?  Maybe she knows a way inside!"

Stumbling forward, Ada shot her a filthy look, then righted herself.  That Vivi was here meant this was the right place to be.  Probably.

She strode over to the girl and crossed her arms.  "Why are you sitting there?"

Vivi rotated her head up.  "Uh..." She looked away when she recognized Ada.  "Hey."  A thin layer of snow matted the top of her head, gathering in the natural creases caused by fluffy, blue earmuffs.  "I wasn't sure this was the right place."  She exhaled, breath visible in a puff for a few seconds as it floated upward.

"How long have you been sitting there?"

"Couple minutes."

"Were you just going to wait for somebody to come get you?"

She shrugged.

Rolling her eyes, Ada held out a mittened hand.  "Stand up.  I do not want you too cold practice."

Vivi stared blankly between the hand and Ada, then grasped it.  She was extremely light, and when she stood, Ada nearly pulled her into the street.  Vivi collided into her, and they each let go of each other quickly, letting relieved breaths when they were a sufficient distance apart.  "Thanks," Vivi muttered, dusting off her hips.  "Do you know where to go?"

Ada made a vexed sound.  "No, I do not."  She surveyed the gate beside her.  Upon closer inspection, it appeared quite intricate.  It was comprised of several panels of geometric shapes, seemingly thatched together with metal wiring.  These panels fit together like puzzle pieces, separated by little, nearly transparent strands of cabling, making the shapes on the gate almost appear to be floating.  Each of these little strands looked quite thin.  Ada walked up and rattled the gate.  It hardly budged.  Apparently they were also quite sturdy.

Conscience tapped her on the shoulder and pointed to the side of the gate where a small, terminal was embedded in the wall.  A blue light blinked subtly above it.

"Why did you not point that out before?"

"Huh?" Vivi said.

She tsked.  "Nothing."  Ada strode over to the terminal and jammed her mitten into a small button labeled 'Call' between the 'Report' and 'Unlock' buttons.  A wave emanated across the terminal, and then it went completely blank.  Ada frowned at it, poking it some more.  Then the screen flashed, and on it appeared Iroha's face.  She squinted out of the screen.

"Ada, is that you?"

"Yes," Ada said, arms folded, tapping her foot.  "Can you open this gate?"

"Yeah yeah!  Umm... wait just a sec.  Everybody got here just a minute ago, I was waiting out front but... Just hang on."  Her face disappeared, leaving a glimpse into the room beyond.  Ada spotted a brick fireplace behind a large table, set with twelve chairs... and was that a chandelier?  Suddenly an unseen man's voice came through the terminal.

"Iroha!  How many times have I told you not to leave this on!"  The terminal winked out, then back, showing the buttons like it had before.

Ada rolled her eyes.  She caught a slight smile on Vivi's face, though.  In fact, she rather resembled Conscience.

A few moments later, the gate began to open, sliding into the wall with a sort of quiet grace.  Ada watched until it had fully retracted, then struck up a brisk pace down the road, Vivi following in her wake.

They walked for about five minutes. The path lead upwards, winding back and forth around small hills snow-covered trees.  When they finally crested the top, they were treated with a view of a quite large mansion.  Vivi stopped when she saw it.  "Is that it?" she asked, a little breathlessly.

Ada continued onward.  She did not like to answer stupid questions.

At the door, Ada took off her mitten to knock, but before her fist made contact it burst open and Iroha peeked out.

"Ah!" She said.  She flung open the door.  "Come in!  Come in!  It's super cold."

Ada and Vivi stomped inside, Iroha closing the door behind them.  As they remove their coats and boots, Iroha spoke hurriedly.

"Skye and Jesse are already down in the arena.  They got her so fast! I didn't know if I should show them where to go or wait for everybody!  I'm sorry, I should have been there."

"It's okay," Vivi said, tapping her boots on the floor to get the snow off.  "Got here eventually."

"I know but, what if you got lost?!  It's horrible to think about."

"Really it's fine."

Ada neatly tucked her mittens in the pocket of her hung-up coat, and rounded on Iroha.  "Where should we go?"  She did not have time to placate Iroha's worries.  Today would be a busy day, and she wanted to start training as soon as possible.

Iroha seemed to have forgotten their purpose.  She blinked, then suddenly beamed at Ada.  "To the basement!" she nearly shouted.  She darted off, beckoning them to follow.

Some part of Ada had not really believed that Iroha's uncle owned an entire GDL arena.  That was preposterous!
