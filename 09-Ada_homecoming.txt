Ada closed the door of her locker a bit harder than she intended, and she felt the books inside tumble out of the stack in which she had just haphazardly placed them.  With an exasperated groan, she reopened the door and restacked them.  Thus far, the week had been... irritating.  She could not stop thinking about Proud, which prevented her from focusing on her school work, and she could not distract herself at home by watching GDL videos, or reading articles because Mother had taken all of that away as a punishment.  It had all put her in a foul temper.

“Um, excuse me?” A boy spoke behind Ada.  She turned around, and her mood must have shown on her face because he flinched back.  For propriety’s sake she smoothed her features.

“Yes?” she said cooly.

The boy, a rather tall specimen with a mouse-like face - and someone whom Ada thought might have sat next to her in the previous class - looked around nervously.  Students around them milled about the hallway during the between period of the two afternoon classes.  It was longer than normal, and provided a good time for the slacker students to sit around and do nothing.  “I...I think somebody was was asking for you in the Mrs. Corey’s classroom.”

Ada crossed her arms, looking up at him.  “Asking for me?  Who?”

“You should just go and see for yourself,” he said, not looking at her.  He looked suspiciously nervous.

“I see,” she said.  She turned and closed her locker.  “What is your name?”

The boy looked taken-aback.  “I’m Liam.”

“Liam,” Ada repeated.  “I will go to Mrs. Corey’s classroom, but if this is some kind of prank, I will come find you with some additional questions.”  Abruptly she picked up her book bag and her pencil box and strode passed him, down the hallway towards the stairs to the second floor.  Liam stared after her.

As she rounded the corner and entered the staircase, Conscience took stride beside Ada.  “What do you think this is about?”

“I do not know,” said Ada.  “But I suppose we will find out soon enough.”

“He makes me a bit anzy,” said Conscience, shivering.  “Whatever it is, can’t be too good.”

“Relax,” said Ada.  “I’m sure it is nothing important.  He did not look to have the intelligence to outwit me.”

“You know, somebody’s going to come along and put you in your place someday,” Conscience said.

“And I shall relish the day that comes,” Ada said.  “But until then, I must assume that everyone else here is an idiot.  Especially boys like him.”

Conscience chuckled, though certainly not in agreeance - more of a condescending laugh if anything.  Ada decided to ignore it-- for now.

At the top of the stairs, Ada took a left and headed down the senior hallway, towards Mrs. Corey’s classroom.  Unlike the hallway downstairs, which had been filled with idle freshmen, this one was almost completely vacant.  Two senior girls with black hair sat by their lockers, quickly finishing an assignment for their next class, and at the very end, a boy helped a teacher fill a cart of books from a stack near the wall.

When she arrived at her destination, Ada glanced through the window near the door and saw that the lights were off.  She frowned, glancing back at Conscience, who just shrugged.  Ada opened the door and went inside.

The room had one occupant: a boy, a sophomore perhaps, who sat by the window, looking out, foot twitching nervously.  Ada did not recognize him.  He seemed very well put-together, with hemmed pants and combed, blonde hair, though he did not notice her come in.   She had to walk close to his desk before he looked up.

“Ah!” he exclaimed, jumping in surprise.  “You’re here.”  Ada noticed that he was also rather tall, even taller than Liam.  She took a step back so she did not have to tilt her head as much just to look at him.  She folded her arms and waited for an explanation.

He held that same, odd nervousness that Liam had, glancing around before he spoke.  “I am… well this is kind of awkward,” he stammered.  He did not meet her eyes, as she spoke.  “I’m Aiden.”

“Okay...” Ada said slowly, eyes narrowing.

“I just wanted to…you see… I just had to ask you...” He shook his head.  “I’m really bad at this kind of thing.”  He took a deep breath, all while Ada stared incredulously at him.  “You see, homecoming is coming up, and… I was wonderingifyouwouldgooutwithme.”  The last of it came out as if it were one single word, and he breathed heavily for a moment after he spoke.

Ada just stared at him in silence.  A large well of adrenaline began creeping up from her stomach, but she shoved it back down in annoyance.  Beside Ada, Conscience suppressed a giggle.

Gathering her thoughts, Ada rubbed her temples.  “Let me get this straight,” she said.  “You wanted me in her just to ask me out to homecoming?”

Aiden nodded apologetically, bouncing on the balls of his feet, clearly anxious to see what her response would be.

“But we do not even know each other.  I only just learned your name.  What would possibly compel me to say ‘yes’ to that request?”

Aiden visibly deflated, a crestfallen look entering his face.  “Because,” he said desperately.  “I thought you were kind of cool.  All the freshmen talk about you, you know.  Most of them are actually kind of afraid of you," he looked askance at her.  "But I'm not!  You're smart and confident and...  You seem so much different from the other girls.  I wanted to get to know you.”  He gave his best smile, though it was not very good, and Ada saw through to his sheer nervousness.

She took a step back from him.  “I see.  Well, I am not interested in going to homecoming.  So the answer is ‘no’.”  She turned around and waved a dismissive hand.  “And please try to be more clever with your isolation tactics on another one of your targets.  This one was rather poorly thought out.”  She strode from the room.

Outside, Conscience burst into laughter.  “That was so cute,” she said, tears forming in her eyes.  “He was so nervous.  I can’t believe I was so suspicious before.  And I think you almost turned beet red.”  She broke into a fit of giggles.

Ada sighed, and began walking to her next class, which happened to be quite far from where she stood.  This whole excursion had been a waste of time, and she was more than a little annoyed.

“You know,” Conscience said, when she calmed down.  “I realize why you turned him down - because of the whole Proud thing and all--”  Ada tensed, but Conscience either did not notice or did not care and plowed on.  “--but he was very handsome.  Worth exploring, if you know what I mean.”

“I do not care,” Ada said stiffly.

Conscience tapped her temple.  “Don’t you think you’re being a bit… Silly?  I mean you can’t stay single forever.”

“No, I do not think I'm being silly,” Ada said, fists clenched.  “I have no time to waste on the neanderthals in this school.  Is that all you think about?  With whom I should ship myself?”

“At least you could have been less mean to him,” Conscience replied, flatly.  “He didn’t deserve that truck-like bluntness.”

“I was not mean,” Ada said, voice growing heated.  She rounded on Conscience.  “I simply told him the truth.  He had to trick me into an isolated room just to have the confidence to speak to me face to face.  And please do not remind me of Proud.  I have been spending all this time trying to calm myself about his situation.”

“Fine,” Conscience said.  “Whatever.  At least Aiden did that for you momentarily.  You were practically your normal self around him.”

Back at the stairs,  a small group of boys were lumbering down to the first floor.  Among them, easily spotted by his height, was Liam.  He was still nervous spotting her and glancing towards Mrs. Corey’s room.  Ada walked pointedly past him, head held high, staring intently forward.

With some luck after this incident, the freshmen boys would all learn to not speak with her.
